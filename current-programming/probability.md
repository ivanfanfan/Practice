Absolutely, let's delve deeper into each chapter, providing more detailed summaries of key theorems, formulas, and concepts.

### Chapter 1: Combinatorial Analysis

1. **Basic Principle of Counting**:
    - **Multiplication Principle**: If a task can be performed in \( m \) ways and another task can be performed in \( n \) ways, then the two tasks can be performed in \( m \times n \) ways.
      \[
      \text{Example: Choosing an appetizer (3 choices) and a main course (4 choices): } 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ways}.
      \]
    - **Addition Principle**: If a task can be performed in \( m \) ways or \( n \) ways, then there are \( m + n \) ways to perform the task, provided the ways are mutually exclusive.
      \[
      \text{Example: Choosing either a red shirt (3 choices) or a blue shirt (2 choices): } 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ ways}.
      \]

2. **Permutations**:
    - **Definition**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) distinct objects.
      \[
      n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 1
      \]
    - **Permutations of \( n \) objects taken \( r \) at a time**:
      \[
      P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Arranging 3 out of 5 books: } P(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!} = 60
      \]

3. **Combinations**:
    - **Definition**: The number of ways to choose \( r \) objects from \( n \) distinct objects without regard to order.
      \[
      C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Choosing 2 out of 5 books: } \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!} = 10
      \]

4. **Multinomial Coefficients**:
    - **Definition**: The number of ways to partition \( n \) objects into \( k \) groups of sizes \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \).
      \[
      \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Partitioning 5 books into 3 groups of sizes 2, 2, and 1: } \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1!} = 30
      \]

5. **Number of Integer Solutions**:
    - **Equation**: The number of non-negative integer solutions of the equation \( x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n \).
      \[
      \binom{n+k-1}{k-1}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Solutions to } x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 4: \binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{6}{2} = 15
      \]

### Chapter 2: Axioms of Probability

1. **Sample Space and Events**:
    - **Sample Space (\( S \))**: The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
      \[
      \text{Example: Tossing a coin } S = \{ \text{Heads, Tails} \}
      \]
    - **Event**: Any subset of the sample space.
      \[
      \text{Example: Event of getting a Head in a coin toss: } A = \{ \text{Heads} \}
      \]

2. **Axioms of Probability**:
    - **Non-negativity**: For any event \( A \), \( P(A) \geq 0 \).
    - **Normalization**: The probability of the entire sample space is 1, \( P(S) = 1 \).
    - **Additivity**: For any two mutually exclusive events \( A \) and \( B \),
      \[
      P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: } P(\text{Heads}) + P(\text{Tails}) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
      \]

3. **Simple Propositions**:
    - **Complement Rule**:
      \[
      P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: } P(\text{Not getting a Head}) = 1 - P(\text{Head}) = 0.5
      \]
    - **Union of Events**:
      \[
      P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Probability of drawing a King or a Red card from a deck: } P(\text{King}) + P(\text{Red}) - P(\text{Red King}) = \frac{4}{52} + \frac{26}{52} - \frac{2}{52} = \frac{28}{52} = \frac{7}{13}
      \]

4. **Sample Spaces with Equally Likely Outcomes**:
    - If a sample space \( S \) has \( n \) equally likely outcomes and \( A \) is an event with \( m \) outcomes, then:
      \[
      P(A) = \frac{m}{n}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die: } P(\{3\}) = \frac{1}{6}
      \]

### Chapter 3: Conditional Probability and Independence

1. **Conditional Probabilities**:
    - **Definition**: The probability of event \( A \) given that \( B \) has occurred.
      \[
      P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \text{ provided } P(B) > 0
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Probability of drawing an Ace given the card is red: } P(\text{Ace | Red}) = \frac{P(\text{Ace and Red})}{P(\text{Red})} = \frac{\frac{2}{52}}{\frac{26}{52}} = \frac{1}{13}
      \]

2. **Bayesâ€™s Formula**:
    - Used to find the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) when the reverse probabilities are known.
      \[
      P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Probability that a patient has a disease given a positive test result: } P(\text{Disease | Positive}) = \frac{P(\text{Positive | Disease})P(\text{Disease})}{P(\text{Positive})}
      \]

3. **Independent Events**:
    - **Definition**: Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
      \[
      P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Probability of rolling a 4 and flipping a Head: } P(\text{4 and Head}) = P(\text{4})P(\text{Head}) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{12}
      \]

### Chapter 4: Random Variables

1. **Random Variables**:
    - A function that assigns a real number to each outcome in the sample space.
      \[
      \text{Example: Let } X \text{ be the outcome of a die roll, then } X = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
      \]

2. **Discrete Random Variables**:
    - Take on a countable number of distinct values.
    - **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: The function \( P(X = x) \) gives the probability that \( X \) takes the value \( x \).
      \[
      \text{Example: PMF of a fair die: } P(X = x) = \frac{1}{6} \text{ for } x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
      \]

3. **Expected Value**:
    - The long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.
      \[
      E(X) = \sum_x x P(X = x) \text{ for discrete random variables}
      \]
      \[
      E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f_X(x) \, dx \text{ for continuous random variables}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Expected value of a fair die: } E(X) = \sum_{x=1

}^{6} x \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5
\]

4. **Variance**:
    - A measure of how much the values of the random variable vary from the expected value.
      \[
      \text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E(X))^2] = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Variance of a fair die: } E(X^2) = \sum_{x=1}^{6} x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1+4+9+16+25+36}{6} = \frac{91}{6}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Var}(X) = \frac{91}{6} - (3.5)^2 = \frac{91}{6} - 12.25 = 2.9167
      \]

5. **Common Discrete Distributions**:
    - **Bernoulli Distribution**: A random variable \( X \) with two possible outcomes 1 (success) and 0 (failure), where \( P(X = 1) = p \) and \( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \).
      \[
      \text{Example: Success in a single coin toss: } P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{2}, \, P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{2}
      \]
    - **Binomial Distribution**: Describes the number of successes in \( n \) independent Bernoulli trials.
      \[
      X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p), \, P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Number of heads in 10 coin tosses with \( p = 0.5 \): } P(X = 5) = \binom{10}{5} (0.5)^5 (0.5)^5 = 0.2461
      \]
    - **Poisson Distribution**: Describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
      \[
      X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda), \, P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Number of phone calls received in an hour: } P(X = 3) = \frac{\lambda^3 e^{-\lambda}}{3!}
      \]

### Chapter 5: Continuous Random Variables

1. **Uniform Random Variable**:
    - A random variable that has an equal probability for all values in an interval \([a, b]\).
      \[
      X \sim \text{Uniform}(a, b), \, f_X(x) = \frac{1}{b-a} \text{ for } a \leq x \leq b
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Time spent waiting for a bus uniformly distributed between 0 and 20 minutes: } f_X(x) = \frac{1}{20} \text{ for } 0 \leq x \leq 20
      \]

2. **Normal Random Variables**:
    - Describes a continuous random variable whose probabilities are defined by the normal (Gaussian) distribution.
      \[
      X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma^2), \, f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Heights of people: } \mu = 170 \text{ cm}, \sigma = 10 \text{ cm}
      \]

3. **Exponential Random Variables**:
    - Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
      \[
      X \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda), \, f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \text{ for } x \geq 0
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Time between arrivals of buses: } \lambda = 1 \text{ per hour}
      \]

### Chapter 6: Jointly Distributed Random Variables

1. **Joint Distribution Functions**:
    - **Joint Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
      \[
      F_{X,Y}(x, y) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Joint distribution of height and weight: } F_{X,Y}(x, y) = P(\text{Height} \leq x, \text{Weight} \leq y)
      \]
    - **Joint Probability Density Function (PDF)**:
      \[
      f_{X,Y}(x, y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} F_{X,Y}(x, y)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Joint density of height and weight: } f_{X,Y}(x, y)
      \]

2. **Independent Random Variables**:
    - Two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent if:
      \[
      f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Heights and weights of people are independent: } f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)
      \]

### Chapter 7: Properties of Expectation

1. **Expectation of Sums of Random Variables**:
    - The expected value of the sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values.
      \[
      E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Expected value of sum of two dice: } E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7
      \]

2. **Covariance, Variance of Sums, and Correlations**:
    - **Covariance**: A measure of the joint variability of two random variables.
      \[
      \text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))]
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Covariance of height and weight: } \text{Cov}(X, Y)
      \]
    - **Correlation**: A standardized measure of the relationship between two random variables.
      \[
      \rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X)\text{Var}(Y)}}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Correlation between height and weight: } \rho_{X,Y}
      \]

### Chapter 8: Limit Theorems

1. **Chebyshevâ€™s Inequality**:
    - Provides an upper bound on the probability that the value of a random variable deviates from its mean.
      \[
      P(|X - E(X)| \geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Probability that a fair die deviates from its mean by more than 1.5: } P(|X - 3.5| \geq 1.5) \leq \frac{1}{1.5^2} = 0.444
      \]

2. **Weak Law of Large Numbers**:
    - States that the sample average converges in probability towards the expected value as the sample size grows.
      \[
      \bar{X}_n \overset{P}{\rightarrow} \mu
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Average of fair coin tosses converging to 0.5 as the number of tosses increases.}
      \]

3. **Central Limit Theorem**:
    - States that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution.
      \[
      \frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \overset{d}{\rightarrow} \text{Normal}(0, 1)
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Sum of fair dice rolls approaches a normal distribution as the number of rolls increases.}
      \]

### Chapter 9: Additional Topics in Probability

1. **Poisson Process**:
    - A stochastic process that counts the number of events in a fixed interval of time or space, where these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.
      \[
      P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
      \]
      \[
      \text{Example: Number of phone calls received in an hour.}
      \]

2. **Markov Chains**:
    - A stochastic process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space.
      \[
      P(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n, \ldots,

X_0 = x_0) = P(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n)
\]
\[
\text{Example: States of a board game where the next move depends only on the current position.}
