All right.
Fareed Zakaria is Out Front now,
the host of Fareed Zakaria GPS.
So Fareed
You know,
while Will was reporting
and you know Will,
Will and I on the show together
so many times
and most of his reports
go to bars and tone in China,
most of the time they censor them.
They did not censor this.
A report about,
a potential invasion of Taiwan,
beginning with a U.S.
general saying that they are not,
practicing, that they are
they are literally rehearsing.
These aren't drills
and they don't censor it.
What is really at stake here tonight?
These are the highest stakes.
And the Trump administration
has badly bungled this.
The greatest deterrent to a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan,
which would send,
you know, decisive ripples
through the world economy,
through the international
political system.
The greatest deterrent was not any weapon
we had.
It was the fear that China had that
they would be decoupled
from the American economy.
The economy with which they had
for the last 40 years
built a deep,
interdependent relationship.
Trump has fired that gun
pointlessly, without a plan,
without a strategy,
as far as I can tell
that the tariffs on China
were raised to 145%
simply because he wanted to save face.
You know, he was
he was backtracking
and flip
flopping on all the other tariffs.
So he needed to turn China
into the into his punching bag.
But because of that,
what he has done is play into China's
hardliners hands.
They have been so
waiting for this decoupling.
They practiced it during Covid.
They practiced it
during the Shanghai lockdown.
And now what
they're going to say is, look,
if we go into Taiwan,
what do we have to lose?
We've already been cut
off from the American market.
I mean, it is
stunning to consider that
this may be where this goes.
And you talk about the
the path from tariffs to war.
a precipitous one.
You know, in China.
I want to just show
this will really, you know,
show that post
that the Foreign Ministry
recently posted on this post,
Fareed, has now 13 million views.
So what of
is the former leader
Mao Zedong, speaking
during the Korean War era?
Now, that is the last time
the Korean War,
when China and America
were actually at physical war
clashing on a battlefield, right?
That's being posted now.
And he says in part, Mao,
no matter
how long this war lasts,
we will never yield.
And that is trending now in China.
you know,
I know this feeds
into what you're talking about, but
but the symbolism here is
so culturally significant
that the
the beginning of China's
modern history
that every schoolchild is
taught in history books
is that China was forced and humiliated
by Western powers,
including the United States,
in the 19th century,
and had to back down
and had to accept,
humiliation
and a kind of neocolonial arrangement
with the foreign powers.
And the message of Chinese history
is never yield like that again.
We will never allow ourselves
to be put in a position like that.
Look in the Chinese
have a fairly strong hand.
a lot of the things
the United States imports from China.
precursors to chemical
to chemical, you know, pharmacy drugs,
chemicals,
minerals, these are all core things,
computer chips.
I think I saw one, one, one number
that said 60% of the chips.
We, we import our Chinese chips.
We need that stuff.
It's not going to be easy to find it
somewhere else.
You can find rare
earth all over the world.
the Chinese, on the other hand,
a lot of what they get from us
agriculture, soybeans, things like that
they can get from elsewhere.
And most importantly, don't forget,
China is a dictatorship.
XI Jinping doesn't
have to worry
about public opinion
in quite the same way that Donald Trump
has to worry about it.
No, you also just came out
with an op ed freed,
and you talk about the tariffs.
And in this
you write about your own context on it.
Growing up in India,
a country obviously riddled with tariffs
and where,
I mean, no business
could survive of any size,
it was all about
what kind of government
handout you were getting or who
you know you were.
It was just it was corruption.
You go on to say,
when I got to America,
I was thrilled to see that
most businesses went about their work
with little care as to
who was in the white House.
But now I watch tech pioneers
give interviews
slavishly extolling Trump's
genius and Wall Street titans
race to post North Korea style.
Congratulations to the president
for his brilliance
in rescuing the economy
from his own actions.
And I wonder what country am I living in?
You know, how significant is
this moment for you, Fred,
as you see this?
It's a very sad moment, honestly,
because to me, you know, as a kid
coming, coming to America,
America was the,
you know, the city on the hill,
a shining example
of how a modern economy should work.
You have a market, you have rules.
You have laws.
You know, everybody plays by them.
It doesn't matter whether you know, the
the Prime minister, the president,
you know, a senator
that wasn't important.
What was important was the merit.
Did you have a good product?
Could you sell it to people?
And now when you look
at the orgy of corruption
that is going to be unleashed.
We have studies already
from the first Trump term,
firms that gave money to
Republicans got more exemptions
than firms that gave money to Democrats.
You know, already
you have Vietnam saying,
we're going to
we're going to expedite
the Trump, organizations project.
Real estate projects are being signed
in 19 countries
with the Trump Organization right now.
You know, all of it says to you
that this is an economy
where political favor, knowing people,
all that has become the key,
not the market, which was the glory
of American, of the of America,
the American economy.
All right. Fareed, thank you very much.
And I just want to show everyone
what is on screen right now
in China as this report aired, as I said,
this is
this is just when free
when Fareed was talking about Mao Zedong
and we had that particular
part of the conversation,
it went to bars
for the rest of the conversation.
Will please report all of that.
They did not censor.
I say that
just to emphasize the closeness
with which they are watching.
This and making these decisions.
So the part about invading Taiwan,
they obviously wanted
that to go out there now,
it was censored, obviously,
during the Mao Zedong comments.
