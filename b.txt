good day today is Monday 17th March 2025 and I'm going to begin today's
program by discussing again the military situation in the conflict in Ukraine and
then subsequently I will be turning to the Diplomatic situation ouros in the
Diplomatic situation now that it's been confirmed that the much expected
telephone conversation between Trump and Putin will take place tomorrow that's on
Tuesday 16th March 2025 let's first of all begin with the
military situation because over the last couple of days there's been as I discussed at length in this program a
huge amount of discussion about whether or not there really is an encirclement
of Ukrainian troops in kosk region and what exactly is happening there well we
had more reports over the last couple of hours and these come after the expiry of
the deadline for the Ukrainian troops in kosk region um that um was given to the
ukrainians by Putin and his officials last week now to be clear this deadline
was that the Ukrainian troops lay down their arms and surrender in which case
they would be treated as prisoners of war in the event that they went on
fighting well the implication was that they would be destroyed and if they were
captured after the expiry of the deadline which as I said expired today
at 6:00 a.m. then in accordance with what Putin said when he visited the
front lines in Kos region on Tuesday in that case the um Ukrainian troops
would be treated as terrorists instead according as Putin claimed to the
Russian laws to Russian domestic laws and to what Putin said was international
law I I want to say again just to make clear that I think he's wrong about this
I don't think that these soldiers are terrorists simply by virtue of the fact
of marching into kque region if they have actually committed war crimes then
that is a completely different thing but I don't think they can be defined as terrorists but that is a legal opinion
which Putin I suppose will contest and I'm not here to argue about it anyway um
that was the deadline it has now passed apparently there have been quite a few
surrenders over the last couple of days and hours but nothing like a mass
surrender of Ukrainian units and presumably from this point onwards if
any Ukrainian troops um are captured um in Co region or are captured after
they've been pushed into Sumi region in Ukraine and are then discovered to have
been previously in Kos region then according to Putin's previous instructions they
will from now won't be treated as terrorists and will be treated differently from other Ukrainian troops
who the Russians have captured in the past that at least is my own understanding of the position anyway
what is the situation in K region now earlier this morning uh we had two
reports from one of the Ukraine Russian commanders in the area I called him
Russian even though he is in fact upti alov who is the head of the akat Special
Forces uh unit and um Aladin is of course a chin though again to repeat the
akat Special Forces uh unit as explained to us on the Duran by Patrick Lancaster
is not an ethnic unit it is not made up only of churchan Fighters as I had at
one time supposed it is a Special Forces Unit which clearly is part of the
Russian military alog together but does not seem to be exactly within the
Russian army I am not clear as to exactly what its legal status is but
suffice to say that apparently a large number of the men who serve in it
perhaps even than the majority are uh Russian slaves anyway I'm not going to
debate this this is not really relevant to today's discussion anyway according
to alaf as of this morning the ukrainians only had control of three
communities three villages in other words in Kos region and he said this they're trying
to hold only three communities but by any forces and capabilities but in
actual fact they are failing in this attempt I cannot count in advance how many bodies of our enemies there will be
but I think they are suffering very serious casualties and this is what they
are doing so that was what ala said that there's just three villages left that
are still being fought over in this area yesterday a group of forces nor North as
I discussed extensively in my previous video said that uh zalinski and syki and
the Ukrainian High command are continuing to rush troops into the Battle Zone um um that they are
preventing troops from retreating they're still trying to cling on to territories inside
kusk despite the enormous problems of logistics and supply and all of that
and alardin in effect is confirming this in his comments this morning that the
ukrainians are still trying to cling on to three villages
the token appearance that they still hold Russian
territory apparently continues to be so important politically to
zalinski and for his political Pres Prestige that well he can't give up these three
villages and he's prepared to sacrifice more Ukrainian lives in order to keep
them and as I pointed out yesterday putting aside the fact that the Russians
apparently control all the access roads that they have um in effect cut off the
Ukrainian troops in cusk and in the areas thereabouts from retreat
this attitude of zalinskis to hold on to these three villages um to the extent
that is possible well that in effect creates the same situation it means that
the ukrainians cannot Retreat they're stuck in cus and they're suffering
apping losses exactly as aloin have said now to finish with alodino he's also
said that he expects that the Russians will then move on after they've cleared
Kos and will advance into Sumi region and will establish a buffer buffer zone
there and just to finish he said this he said our enemy is suffering heavy losses
despite deploying its best reserves to the suja and Sumi directions pulling them from other areas this will benefit
our other units which are advancing along the entire line of Engagement and
we will see he's absolutely right about that the Russian offensives everywhere
else on the contact line have resumed we will soon see the results not only will
we have liberated our own land but we will also establish the buffer zone that
the Supreme commander-in-chief has tasked us with creating we will accomplish this as well so it looks as
if the Russian troops who are conducting the operations in kusk region have now
been given definite orders to continue the advance
in Tumi region as well to advance beyond
the Russian Frontier into Sumi region also and note that this order has been
given despite all the talk and chatter about
ceasefires and all of that so that's the Su situation according to API Al Alin
now just to say group of forces North have also provided one of their regular
bulletins about the situation and um I will read it it was
published today but it covers the situation yesterday and this is what
group of forces North say on March 16th group of forces North continue to carry
out tasks to liberate Kos region we continue to grind down the units of the
Ukrainian forces inexorably bringing closer the
day of the complete liberation of the suja Borderland not the town of suja
here but the Border area um south and
west of it from the Ukrainian occupies we have driven the enemy out of most of
goola this is one of the villages I presume that um alod was talking
about and um and are completing the cleanup of the area around the village
but it is too early to talk about the complete liberation of the village now I spoke yesterday about how if the
Russians do capture goola then if one looks at a map it's
very difficult to see how it will be possible any longer to deny that the
Ukrainian troops in this area are indeed cut off just saying but anyway that's uh
that's um um apparently that battle is still underway and then uh they go on to
say uh the group of forces North goes on to say Fierce fighting continues in the
forest belts along the suja yakova highway yakova is a important Village
which is the place to which the ukrainians are retreating and where many
speculate they will try to establish their next defense line if um this
Village is captured by the Russians then that um supposedly opens
up the way for the Russians to advance all the way to the city of the the city
of Sumi itself at least that is what some people are claiming I I'm not going
to get into the details of this this no doubt others will take different views
but anyway that's certainly it is on the main road to this city of Sumi a little
to the Southwest anyway uh the Russians are supposedly moving closer towards
this road upon which Unova is located and presumably the reference to
yakova hints that this Village May indeed be a target for the Russians and
then the um group of forces North goes on to say
the hoisting of the Russian flag by um Marines armed Marines from a drone on
the outskirts of guo now that is another Village in this area demoralize the
Ukrainian troops remaining in the village who realize that the air space above the village is completely
controlled by our Intelligence Officers so group of forces North is not claiming
that they've captured the village of guo they are simply saying that um
they've managed to plant a Russian flag in this Village using a drone and this
has demonstrated that the Russians control the airspace over the village I
have to say to me that looks like more of a stunned than anything else but at
least group of forces North have admitted as much in the past I remember
that many that the parties but especially the ukrainians have inserted
drones on territory controlled by the other side and have claimed that that
brings the territory under their control I remember this happened quite a lot during the Battle of kinki over a year
ago now the ukrainians planted drones on villages on the Russian side of the
River claims or wanted to suggest that the presence of these flags um somehow
meant that the villages in question were under Ukrainian control when in fact the drones had simply been planted by
Ukrainian drones well that clearly is no is was not the case then and with
respect to guo it is not the case either
but the fact that group of forces North is talking about gu
suggests that they expect that guo will indeed be attacked fairly soon and then
group of forces North goes on to say the armed forces the Ukrainian Armed Forces
command transferred a group of Spanish speaking mercenaries Colombians question mark to
the forest area south of gova they refused to participate in the fighting
after coming under artillery fire and fled in the direction of yakova with
losses now there's been a huge amount of discussion about the presence of North
Korean troops in Kos region there still claims that there's up to 12,000 of them
in Kos region there is still and I want to stress this not a particle of proof
that that is actually the case the ukrainians have produced various bits and Bobs of what they say
is evidence that the North Koreans have been deployed by the Russians in Kos
region but they have never provided um proof that would stand up to Critical
examination now I say this because the media in Britain at least has got back
into the habit of talking about the presence of North Korean troops in Kos
region these troops if they exist are invisible because I have never seen any
proof of their existence but about the presence of
mercenaries from all sorts of places fighting in kque region on the Ukrainian
side there is a certain amount of evidence I'm not going to try and guess
how many of these people there ever were there probably not that many but at
least there's been some evidence that there is some and here we see group of forces North claiming that there was a
contingent of Spanish speaking uh mercenaries perhaps Colombians fighting
in the area of gulfa now one of the interesting developments
about the fighting in ksk region is that over the last couple of
hours zalinski and apparently it was his
decision has reacted to what has happened um by sacking the chief of the
general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces and he's been sacked and he's
been replaced by General gnat who was previously the uh land forces Commander
the um commander of Ukraine's land forces so a few days ago we got reports
the general Cil nikov the Ukrainian overall commander the the the the
operations Commander the battlefield commander in Kos region had been sacked
by the Ukrainian High command now they've sack the chief of staff the
chief of the general staff a very senior military officer there's been much criticism of
him recently but he's been sacked and it looks like he too is being made a
scapegoat for this disaster in KK region and gnat as I said has taken over from
him s uh zalinski by the way has also held a meeting today of top military
Chiefs in Kiev talking about the general military situation the Ukrainian defense
minister Mr omerov I know is one of the people participating in this meeting
one gets the sense that this is a crisis meeting to discuss the rapidly
deteriorating situation on the front lines anyway gria forces North actually
comments on these re shuffles the reshuffle and the command of the Ukrainian Army the appointment of gnat
as chief of the general staff is probably related to the defeat of the enemy group in the souja Border area at
the same time zalen apparently intends to keep syi who is completely loyal to
him in his position that is my impression also there's been rumors at
various times that zalinski was looking to sack sski but it looks as if that's not going
to happen after all and then group of forces North goes on to say that the
total advance of our troops in kosk region was 3.4 kilm 11 units of enemy
armored vehicles were destroyed so that group of forces North giving a rather
cool description of the fighting in Kos region the Russians continue to advance
the ukrainians continue to retreat there is an operational crisis for the
ukrainians there is no word here about encirclements or expiries of deadlines
or anything like that but nonetheless the Russians clearly hold the initiative and are continuing to advance and two
important Villages out of the three mentioned or probably referred to by
um uh um by um referred to um who uh by
referred to by Alin that at least two of these V Villages go go
and go goo are likely to pass under Russian control fairly quickly so that's
group of forces North now interestingly we have had a long descriptions of the
fighting in Kos region from the BBC and from The New York Times and they
both tell the same story a catastrophic disaster
and well I'm going to take my account from the BBC which is after all closer to home in Britain and um it's probably
um what most British readers and viewers people who follow the news um will have
picked up pick up picked up on
and it makes it gives an absolutely harrowing account and I will anticipate
by saying that it seems to me to confirm that Ukrainian troops in many places in
kusk region have indeed been encircled and cut off and that what Putin was
saying on Wednesday is not at all far from the truth everything is finished
that's the title Ukrainian troops reli Retreat from kusk and it was published
today and the correspondence of Jonathan Beal and Anastasia
levchenko and it absolutely describes a horrifying situation Ukrainian soldiers
fighting in Russia's kusk region have described scenes like a horror movie as
they retreated from the front line the BBC has received extensive accounts of
Ukrainian troops who recount a catastrophic withdrawal in the face of
heavy fire and Columns of military equipment equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian
drones the soldiers who spoke over social media were given aliases to
protect their identity in other words protect them from the
Ukrainian um law enforcement agencies I think that's worth pointing out because
who else do they need protection from and implicit admiss
from the BBC that not all is quite as
free and Democratic in Ukraine as perhaps in Britain we're led to believe
I I would quickly say that we are talking about fighting we are talking about battle and um troops are under
military discipline and I presume that they're not supposed to speak to journalists but
anyway it is interesting that they've been given IES and the way in which the
um BBC admits that they have to be protected
um by concealing their identities
anyway Some Gave accounts these are some of the soldiers who the BBC has been in
contact with some gave accounts of a collapse as Ukraine La suja the largest
town it held Ukrainian restrictions on travel to the front meant meant it is
not possible to get a full picture of the situation but it is how five
Ukrainian soldiers described to us what happened and first we have a soldier
called volodimir and um he um was in touch with
the BBC on the 9th of March that's to say more than a week ago at that time he
was still in suja but he says that there was panic and this is a quote direct quote from him panic and collapse on the
front Ukrainian troops and this is another quote are trying to leave
Columns of troops and Equipment some of them are burned by Russian drones on the
road it is impossible to leave during the day movements of men Logistics and
Equipment have been reliant on one major Road between suja and Ukraine sui region
it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago by 9th
March it was quote all under the fire control of the enemy drones Around the
Clock in m one minute you can see two or three drones that's a lot we have all
the logistics here on one suure Sumi Highway and everyone knew that the
Russians would try to cut it but this again came as a surprise to our
Command so that was um volodimir he's
describing a situation where the Ukrainian troops in suja had their
supplies cut and where retreat was impossible or very difficult Retreat to
sui region was impossible or very difficult and where the Ukrainian
columns that tried to flee towards Sumi were were burnt by the drones on the
only usable Escape Route which is exactly what the Russians have told us
then the BBC was in contact on the 11th of March with
another Ukrainian soldier called Maxim um a few days ago we received an
order to leave the defense lines in an organized Retreat um he said adding that Russia
had aass a significant Force to retake the town including large numbers of
North Korean soldiers we don't have as I said any factual evidence that they are
there we're told the BBC says that not not they say military experts not Maxim
they've said that there are up to 70,000 Russian troops seeking to retake kusk
the area around kusk including 12,000 North Korean I think both well I think the Korean
number North Korean number is f is fiction and I think 70,000 for the total force that the
Russians have deployed is almost certainly a big overstatement just
saying anyway um Maxim then goes on to say that the Russians sent their best drone units to the front and were using
kamikazi and fpv drones to take control of the main Logistics route the these
include drones linked to oper operators by fiber optic wires well you've heard
this from me many times and for many others which are impossible to jam with
electronic counter measures and then we have the admission and this is a direct quote again the
enemy Mount managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment wrecks have created
congestion on supply routes so that's Maxim again talking about
horrific situation finding it very very difficult to withdraw from suja the
Russians have F control over the roads and when the ukrainians try to retreat
along them their forces are picked off and destroyed by the Russian drones and
then we have a further Soldier Anton he uh also speak speaks about the
Russian drones we used to have an advantage in drones now we do not Russia
has an advantage with more accurate air strikes and a greater number of troops
and Anton also complains about the logistics Logistics no longer work
organized deliveries of weapons ammunition food and water are no no longer possible he managed to leave suja
by foot at night we almost died several times drones are in the sky all the
time and then he said that uh the ukrainians um will almost certainly lose
their entire foothold in Kos region fairly soon and he admits that from a military point of view the kusk
direction has exhausted itself there is no point in keeping it anymore which is
pretty much what I've been saying all along and the BBC tells is that there
were around 12,000 Ukrainian troops in kusk when the Russian blow fell they
were some of the best trained soldiers equipped with Western supplied equipment
including tanks and armored vehicles again I've been saying this on this
channel for weeks and months and by the way those same claims have been all over
the Russian internet and then um we're told and this is presumably also
from um Maxim that um the ukrainians abandoned most of their
material and then we have dimitro another Ukrainian
Soldier um and he was spoken to on the 11th and 12th of
March and he likened The Retreat from the front to a scene from a horror movie
The roads are littered with hundreds of destroyed cars armored vehicles and
allterrain vehicles there are a lot of wounded and dead Vehicles were often
hunted by multiple drones he described his own Aros Escape when the car he was
traveling in got bogged down he and his fellow soldiers were trying to push the
vehicle free when they were targeted by another fbv drone it missed the vehicle
but injured one of his comrades he said they had to hide in a forest for 2 hours
before they were rescued and he spoke of ukrainians retreating on foot guys walking 15 kilm
to 20 kilm the situation had turned from difficult and critical to
catastrophic everything is finished in Kos region and this he said on the 14th
of March the operation was not successful and that is an extraordinary
uh admission rather not an extraordinary admission it's an understatement of the
fact I would say and then we have
Aro he uh insists that the operation did have some success he's now in hospital
where he's been treated treated from shrapnel wounds suffered in a drone
attack and um well that's all he's apparently able to say and um we read
the BBC itself um repeats sir's claim that the
Ukrainian forces had pull back to more favorable positions remain in kusk and
would do so for as long as it is expedient and necessary and then the BBC says that the
situation now is very different last all August um and any hopes that Ukraine
would be able to trade Kus for some of its own territory have significantly
diminished which again is an almost laughable
understatement so that's the BBC now once heard all that
account how is it possible to argue in light of all of this that Ukrainian
troops groups in kosk are not encircled at least in many places even those
who've been able to escape find themselves trying to flee along roads
over which the Russians have complete control drones and
artillery in some cases surely it would have been better if they' stayed where
they were and simply surrendered um and that it seems to me is what has
been happening in Kos and you've got it from the BBC the New York Times by the
way describes things in pretty much the same way so that's C now
elsewhere the situation for the ukrainians continues to get worse and
indeed over the last 48 to 7 76 hours we've seen a
further evidence of more um Russian advances right across the contact line
to begin with in kpin the area around kpin a major increase a swelling in the
size of the Russian Bridge head across the Oscar River I discussed this
yesterday in my program there's little explanation as to how this came about DS
the Ukrainian reporting channel has only just confirmed it but it looks like this has been ongoing for several days or
perhaps even weeks but suddenly it's clear that the Russian Bridge head
across the oscal river is much bigger than we ever had been led to believe
before and it looks as if a very powerful Russian Force is now being
assembled on the West Bank of the Oscar River and it could Advance South towards
kpin which would surely fall fairly quickly if it were
attacked um from the North in that way at the same time that the Russians are
positioned to the east of it or alternatively or perhaps in conjunction
with an attack towards kin the Russians could Advance um North and westwards
deeper into k region and perhaps work to link up with their forces in volans
where group of forces North has also been advancing so a major crisis for the
ukrainians there but also a huge Cascade of information now coming from the
ukrainians about the situation in tesque now the Russian defense Ministry
claimed the toret had been captured fully by the Russians some weeks ago
then as I've discussed in various programs the ukrainians brought a team
of journalists from The Daily Telegraph and claimed that the fighting in toret
was still underway then the ukrainians launched a series of attacks on Tores
which as I pointed out in program after program were plainly intended were
obviously intended to um create the impression that the information given to
the Daily Telegraph was true and that there was still an ongoing battle for
control of toret now
DS is finally acknowledging that the Russians are
indeed in control of most of toret indeed practically all of toret
and that all of these Ukrainian counterattacks have been repelled but it
looks like from the maps that they are publishing that they also acknowledge
that there's a group of Ukrainian troops who are almost trapped inside the
stadium in toret which is one of the targets of these Ukrainian raids so I've
said in several programs that these raids were just another example of
Ukraine pointlessly frittering its Manpower its best
soldiers in pointless operations and here we see what has happened a series
of attacks the Russians have brushed them off and it looks as if they trapped
a group of Ukrainian soldiers I doubt that they're many several dozen at most
but they're trapped in the stadium in they will either be captured or killed
and what in the end was the point of that just a sec meanwhile the Russians
continue to Advance North of osena um and
um um east of pakros they seem to have repelled all the Ukrainian
counterattacks um near pakros Dennis pushilin the head of the donet regional
government the Russian controlled donet Regional government says that the Russians are again advancing in the area
of pakros and the Russians are also advancing west of
elika Yobo Silka and there are some claims that they are aiming
to trap the remaining Ukrainian troops troups in villages to the west of the
andreeva Fortified Area which has fallen under Russian control and perhaps most
alarming for the ukrainians of all the Russians have made some significant advances North in
the zapor roia area um west of
orov and even the daily Telegraph today
um in some alarm um confirmed that the
situation there there was deteriorating that the Russians had pierced the
Ukrainian front lines in zapar roia region so this is the military situation
this is the actual real military situation um zalinski denied a couple of
days ago that Ukrainian troops were encircled in suja in kusk region well
Ukrainian soldiers themselves have told the BBC that the situation is catastrophic they talk about lines of
retreat being either blocked or incredibly dangerous they talk about
hundreds of people being killed large amounts of equipment destroyed they talk
about a catastrophic situation something out of a horror movie I said in a couple
of Pro in in in a couple of programs ago that this was the worst defeat the one
in kusk that the Ukrainian Army has suffered since the commencement of the
special military operation who any longer can question this now
there was a huge amount made as I remember in the Autumn of
2022 about the supposed success of Ukraine's counter offensive in khov
region which did indeed capture places like ium and balaca and
kin but as I pointed out at the time and since um the Russians actually recre
retreated from this territory with very few losses
the Ukrainian grouping in kque region has been all but
destroyed I'm not going to compare territory the ukrainians supposedly held
up to 1500 square kilometers of territory inside kosk region at one time
from memory but I may be completely wrong here from memory this is not that
different it's not orders of magnitude different from the territory that the
ukrainians recaptured in khaka region during their offensive in the Autumn of
2022 but the ukrainians inflicted no big blows no real damage to the Russian army
whereas the Ukrainian forces in kque region well I think all but
destroyed would not overstate the
reality anyway there we go now all of this news from the battlefronts is
taking place on the eve of a telephone
conversation between Putin and Trump Putin on Wednesday when he gave his
um response to um the American ceasefire
proposal saying uh no but
maybe that was that's how I would describe it I mean Putin basically said
that we cannot accept this proposal this is not in the way that it's been presented to us we can't accept a
proposal without things being worked out in advance ceasefire really isn't to our
advantage anyway at this time but our concern is
that the ukrainians don't take advantage of it anyway um he did
say that all of this could be IR out over the course of discussions and he
floated the possibility of a conversation between himself and uh Donald Trump and as we
know Putin later on that incredibly intense day March 13th even as his
armies were closing the ring around the Ukrainian troops in K region and baning
them to Pieces um over that incredibly long and audious day where he spoken to
lucenko and met with him and spoke to um NBS over the phone Putin also met with
Steve WI off Trump's Envoy who is
now who is now formerly Trump's Ambassador and it seems that
he brought up various points for wit goof to take back to president Trump now
bear in mind an interesting fact about the Putin wit gol meeting which is that
the Russians have never released a readout of it we know that the meeting took place pesov himself Putin spokesman
has confirmed it as of course has wit go himself and as has Donald Trump but we
have no actual readout from either the Russian or American side about what was
discussed over the course of this meeting wiof at least no formal read out
now wiov himself has however been saying a few things
as is Mike Waltz as now has Donald Trump and as is Mark Rubio now Rubio is saying
that there needs to be two stages to the process first the seiz fire and then negotiations the Russians will not like
that and this is not what they want to see at all they don't want they want at
the very least some kind of framework agree greement before they agree to a
ceasefire and that ceasefire must be enforced in the way that they have said
already they they need to have guarantees that Ukraine won't
simply take advantage of the ceasefire so that the fighting restarts all over
again so there's clearly already a difference in American perceptions now
wit goof has said that at Istanbul the
Istanbul agreement of April 2022 continues to be the main framework
for how the negotiations will happen and he also said that over the
course of his discussions with the Russians with Putin uh with um usikov
and Putin on Wednesday um questions of territory
and of the status of the zapoi nuclear power plant and of the ports on the
Black Sea was discussed one wonders which ports he has
in mind is he thinking of marup or is he talking about
adessa and Trump has said that when he speaks to Putin tomorrow
again he will be discussed one of the big topics he will be discussing will be
questions of territory and power stations and again he presumably means
the zapar ROI nuclear power station and of ports as well now this is very
interesting and it's difficult to know exactly what is meant here
because to me that looks like the
Americans now starting to discuss with the Russians the substance of the final
agreement they're not just talking about in other words how the mechanics of a ceasefire how a ceasefire is going to be
enforced how the ceasefire is going to work they are talking about the
substantive questions of what territory is to be controlled by
whom what the status of the ports will be and I assume here that the reference
the major references to adessa I don't really see what the issue with marup
is but anyway there will be discussions about adessa there
will be discussions of things like this now I'm
assuming that this these discussions originate
from things that the ukrainians have brought up but the point is that the
ukrainians Apparently brought up these topics over the course of the Riad meeting between
Rubio and um the ukrainians the Riad sorry the jeda meeting between R uh ruia
wals and white go and the Russians oh sorry and the America and and the
ukrainians but to say it again th this is taking us
beyond the question of a ceasefire so it looks
again as if we are looking at some kind of discussion about the final out
outlines of the eventual settlement now that is also perhaps
confirmed by C further comments that Russian officials have made one of them
a deputy foreign minister I forget his name has actually said over the last couple of
hours that Russia will require absolutely cast iron guarantees in any
final settlement of the conflict that Ukraine will not enter NATO Trump simply
saying that Ukraine will not enter NATO um Waltz I believe it was Waltz saying
that um it is incredibly unlik likely that Ukraine will ever enter NATO
because it's not just the United States that is opposed to this but most some
Europe other European States also well I doubt that will be enough if I am sure
it will not be enough to satisfy the Russians after all they were given such
assurances before and they were not honored so um the point is it looks as if all of
these topics are going to be discussed and it's
seems as if they're going to be discussed between Trump and Putin
tomorrow now note something that these discussions are taking place directly
between the Americans and the Russians the European an are not a party
to these discussions obviously Trump will be talking to Putin
this will not be a call involving several people stammer and macro and um
Schultz who's still the chancellor by the way in Germany will not be in the
call nor will zalinski of course um
so this is now starting to look look like a
negotiation between the United States and Russia not even a negotiation
between the United States and Ukraine the United States is bargaining with
Russia over territory it's acting to some extent as
Ukraine's Advocate but it is taking the lead in
negotiations Ukraine is not itself involved in the
negotiations now the Americans are talking about acting as
mediators or at least the fact that mediation is needed in this negotiation
and they're positioning themselves as the potential mediators and bear in mind
that the jeder meeting between the Americans and the
ukrainians came up with an agreement that these two countries would
both set up negotiating
teams but there's two things to say about this firstly since the United
States has itself acknowledged that the Ukrainian conflict is a proxy war
between the United States and Russia in other words a conflict between Russia
and the United States it Rubio has said it Trump has said it I believe wit go
white go wit golf has said it too given that this is so given that
this is a conflict how can the United States be a
mediator mediators are people who come from outside the
conflict and are themselves completely neutral the United
States cannot be a mediator in a dispute in which it is itself a party and the
United States is not behaving like a mediator because as I said already with
Go's discussions with Putin on um on Thursday
to the on Wednesday rather to the extent that we know anything about them they
appear to have been more like again a direct negotiation between the Americans
and the Russians and Trump's conversation with Putin tomorrow also looked like a direct
conversation between the Americans and the Russians and well that's not the role
that mediators fulfill Phil now bear in mind that just a few days
ago as I discussed Donald Trump published two truth social posts I seem
to remember that they came out on Thursday and in the first one the more
important one in some ways the one in which he spoke about how Biden had got
the United States into a mess over uh uh into into a mess with
Russia and he that is to say Donald Trump was going to get the United States
out of that mess well in that discussion Trump
didn't mention Ukraine at all he didn't he didn't mention zinski he didn't even
mention Ukraine by name which further confirms that to all in to all intents
and purposes this is a direct negotiation between Russia and the
United States now I have to say that this negotiation
is being conducted at extraordinary speed and
urgency and I think that the Russians themselves are to some extent taken
aback by the speed with which these discussions are happening so I I suspect
is everyone else they are I think
unhappy about Trump's urgency his desire to get this agreement sewn up so fast
and the question again one has to ask oneself is why why is Trump in such a
hurry to get this thing agreed so quickly
and what is what makes him want to do
that and to get so deep into the negotiations himself now I'm not saying
that it doesn't make sense for the United States to want to end the
situation in Ukraine I've already discussed in many places why the United
States would want to extricate from this itself from this war the Russians are
winning the war the ukrainians are losing the war the United States does not want to be again on the side of the
losers in this war Donald Trump does not want to be the party that is responsible
always president the president who is in office when Ukraine is
defeated that goes without saying um Trump also shows every sign of wanting
to reset relations with Russia this is a genuine reset he wants to lift sanctions
he wants to end the sanctions on o Russian oil trade I think this is
becoming by the way increasingly clear there are more and more discussions that this is a priority for Trump in order to
try to bring inflationary pressures in the United States under control that he
wants to reduce the price of oil and that means lifting restrictions on the
trade in Russian oil I've discussed all of this before but I cannot help but
think that Trump knows or senses
something which most of the rest of the media much most of the rest of the
western commentariat and by the way members of
his own team refuse to acknowledge which is that the collapse the military
collapse of Ukraine is much closer Over the Horizon than is widely acknowledged
budanov Ukraine's own intelligence Chief said and this he said this before um
Trump briefly paused supplies of American military equipment and
intelligence and and sharing of intelligence Budan have said that Ukraine has only until
Midsummer and beyond that it will have
major problems continuing the war and a potential defeat is coming I've said in
program after program on this channel that the time is much shorter than many
people seem to understand that if there is going to be an agreement done it has
to be done quickly over the course of the next few weeks or months because if
it is not then in Midsummer we will have a major
crisis Ukraine's Army will start to collapse the
Russians if they conduct they continue their offensive it the area of
pakros and to the West if they enter nepr region and all of that they could
soon reach the river NE the the deeper
River itself in central Ukraine and I've discussed again in many many programs
what a catastrophic result for Ukraine that would be and I have also
discussed in program after program that that if the defeat in Kos more recent
programs that if the defeat of the ukrainians in Kos leads to a major
Russian incursion into Sumi region if
the city of Sumi itself is captured by the Russians and
to repeat again it's claimed that if you nagka this Village that the ukrainians
are now retreating to is captured by the Russians the road to Sumi City
itself is open if the city of Sumi
Falls then the road again starts to open for the Russians to
reach Kiev so
perhaps Trump at some level he's a very instinctive
Pol politician he has a feel for events I get the sense that this is sometimes
more important with him than analysis now that may sound a little
mystical but I've come across people like that before in many um areas of
life by the way including some lawyers that I used to know
who seem to have that feel for events which came independently of any analysis it
was always strange to someone like myself to see but as I said I've come
across it anyway it could be that Trump has that sense that maybe
he's got that overall feeling that there isn't very much time and that if he
waits too long if he doesn't get a ceasefire a cessation of hostilities
within the next few weeks if he doesn't get some kind of agreement with the Russians within the next few weeks or
months then he could be looking around
Midsummer to a major crisis a potential military defeat in
Ukraine which would be deeply embarrassing for him and which might
lead to calls for him to take action which he doesn't want to take well all
of this is of course I say straightforward it speculation I don't know what Donald Trump knows or thinks
at any particular point in time I don't speak to him I never have done just to
say I Sy by the way um seem to think that I do but can I just make it
absolutely clear that I have never spoken to Donald Trump at any point in my life so anyway he doesn't consult me
and I don't speak to him so I don't know what he's thinking on any particular question is but anyway that it seems to
me is the likeliest most plausible explanation for this incredible
urgency and as for the Russians well despite the fact that I think
they're somewhat taken aback by this urgency on Trump of Trumps which I
suspect they analyze in the way that I have just done they probably sense that
Trump knows that the writing is now clearly on the wall for Ukraine and that
Trump therefore is under immense political pressure to come to a deal
quickly the the Russians see this they understand this
and they're cutting him some slack they're prepar to negotiate with him in
this very unconventional way because for the reasons I've given in
many places an outright a simple military
victory in which Russia occupies all of Ukraine though it might potentially be
within reach and in a shorter time scale than many people imagine will simply
create for Russia a host of problems Eve Smith has written about
this especially well will create for Russia a host of problems which the
Russians would probably prefer not to have given that
their concern throughout the entire period of the special military operation
and before as they have discussed in many places and at many times is the
security of their Western borders and of their people including their people in
Ukraine so they're saying to themselves let's try and do a deal even if it's
only a relatively shortterm deal one that will last a couple of years with
Donald Trump while he's still there we can use that time to our benefit to
build up our economy sort out our infrastructure build up our Railways and
our um computers Technologies and uh finished work on our building up our
civil aviation uh the sukhoy superjet has just flown today apparently with the
new all Russian pd8 engines all that kind of thing so that Russia can sort
out and do all of these things and be ready perhaps more ready for the next
round um here I'm going to say something it's absolutely the case that Russia was
taken for a ride over the course of the Minsk agreement that those eight years
those seven years between the signing of the Minsk agreement in February 20 for
2015 and the launch of the special military operation in February
2022 were used by Ukraine to rearm and re-equip and to prepare for war but
about perhaps it's overlooked that the Russians also used that time arguably
far more effectively than Ukraine did they upgraded their Armed Forces to a
much greater extent than Ukraine did over the course of that same period and
it was precisely during those seven years that they took all the necessary
steps to sanction proof their economy it was during this period that they Divi
Diversified their trading relations that they built up their partnership with China that they sorted out their
alternatives to the Swift messaging system that they created the Mir card
that they did all of these things so even if a deal with
Trump a long-term deal with Trump I'm not talking about a deal about Ukraine but a deal that restores some kind of
relationship between the United States and Russia however incomplete and partial it is a deal which gives Russia
more time is concluded this summer or Autumn or
winter then the Russians can use the time it gives them so if in four or
eight or 12 years time a new Administration in Washington appears
that again moves back to outright confrontation with Russia the Russians
are even stronger and in a better position to withstand this than they were when the special military operation
was launched in February 2022 let me make it absolutely clear that I am not
suggesting here that the Russians are looking for a further Minsk agreement
they have already ruled that out they are talking about a long-term sustainable peace with over the conflict
in Ukraine one which addresses as Putin repeatedly says the root causes of the
conflict but I'm talking about a truce a temporary truce in tensions between the
American and Russian superpowers
once given the Trump is there and is prepared apparently to
grant that truth the Russians are saying to themselves let's see whether we can
find a way to agree it
because time is something which always in every
conflict works in the end to Russia's Advantage just to say
anyway even as the Americans and the Russians seem to be edging towards some
kind of process and to stress again um we don't know where this is going we'll
only get a we'll perhaps get a better idea after the Trump Putin call tomorrow
but for the moment we we don't yet have a clear idea of where this is moving if
I have to make a guess I I I'm going to suggest that Putin and Trump will
probably agree to set up expert panels tomorrow something of that kind and maybe the
Russians will confirm the details of their negotiating team and there will be
agreement for the two negotiating teams to meet at some point over the next couple
of days probably in Saudi Arabia again um and maybe there might even be further
agreement to progress towards a Putin Trump Summit meeting probably in Saudi
Arabia again anyway even as that is going on the Europeans
continue to do whatever they
can either to sabotage this process or to adjust it towards further
confrontation now yesterday I discussed this
latest Summit meeting so-called Summit meeting virtual Summit
meeting that Karma conducted in London and I said what a very strange meeting
this was we've never been provided at least I have not been able to find I
checked the foreign office website I checked the Downing Street
website I've never been able to find a complete list of the participants we
until seven 27 countries were involved but I haven't so far been able to find
out find a complete list of which countries those were I've still not been
able to find a list of the leaders that starmar says he spoke to over the course
of this Summit meeting and yet we have statements from starma about
how the plan for this Coalition of the Willing is moving towards some kind of
operational phase and as simplicius The Thinker said
in an article that's come out today and as I discussed in my program yesterday
it's quite clear what the plan is macron has in effect given it away it's for the
to be a ceasefire zalinski will then ask the Europeans to deploy what they
call peacekeepers to Ukraine and the peacekeepers the people
from Britain and France will then enter Ukraine even if the Russians themselves
don't agree an astonishingly Reckless step a step towards
incredible escalation now the Russians have again
spoken out vigorously against this de Med Medvedev Deputy chairman of the
security Council in Russia the hard man if you like in Putin's government um
he's written a telegram Post in which he has spoken in the strongest language
against what macr and starma are doing and have made it has made it absolutely
clear that if these troops are indeed deployed in that way to Ukraine then as
far as the Russians are concerned their combatants and the Russians will strike at them and that they're not acceptable
as peacekeepers the Russians have said that any peacekeeping any purported
peacekeeping contingent that is sent into Ukraine without the authority of the UN
Security Council has no legal standing that troops who enter a war zone are
therefore troops in battle the presence of those European
troops will lead to the collapse of any ceasefire and there will be an attack on
those troops by Russia this is what the Russians are saying so why is
stama persisting in all of this now I think I've discussed these motives in
some Det detail in a program I did with Alex Chorro on the Duran briefly I think
that what starmer is trying to do in his own over complicated way is that he's
trying to bring Britain into a deeper relationship
with the European powers he was always a strong opponent of brexit getting you Britain more involved
again with its former with with its European allies
is a big step towards taking Britain back into um the EU which I am quite
sure remains his ultimate objective but it's also I think ultimately intended
not just to undermine the ceasefire or or or or this whole process between
Russia and the United States when is suspect that at some level it's directed
against Donald Trump the Russians seem to be War trying to warn Trump about
this and I think that Trump is creating risks for himself by
not heeding These Warnings properly because if the European troops do enter
Ukraine and there is a conflict between those troops and the Russians whether he likes it or not
Trump will be faced with an enormous crisis either he abandons those European
troops to their fate in which case he will be accused of betraying them and of
betraying the United States's NATO allies in which case NATO itself could
be collapsed in which case Trump himself will be blamed and might even face
impeachment proceedings it's important to stress that far from the whole
Republican party supports him
or if he does enter the conflict on behalf of those European
troops well the United States is involved in the war could find itself in
a direct confrontation with Russia all of those things that Trump himself says
he wants to avoid I continue to believe
that Trump's evasions about this his
elegant rejections of an American back stop for
the European troops which he gave over the course of macron's and stamas and
zelinsky's visits to was visits to Washington to was it three weeks ago now
I don't think that is enough I think the United States needs to come out straightforwardly and
say that it is not supportive of
this angl French plan to send troops to
Ukraine it does not think that this plan facilitates
peace and that any European country that involves itself in this plan is acting
against the wishes of the United States and I think if the Trump Administration
says that that will kill this whole dangerous proposal stoned dead already
many European countries are making clear their own misgivings about this whole project Maloney in Italy has spoken out
against it Poland wants to have nothing to do with it the Germans are to put it
mildly uneasy and reluctant I think if there was a clear American
statement of intent about this then I think support for it in Europe would
collapse and we'd get this whole issue of European peacekeepers in Ukraine once
and for all out of the
way I would also add that there would be support for Trump on this in Britain and
France as well now I'm not going to talk about France because the fact that there is
opposition in France in the French Parliament the French National Assembly that leen's party and melan's party are
very hostile to this whole idea that I don't think is controversial but we're now starting to
see opposition grow in Britain there's been an article for example in The Daily
Telegraph um by Nick Timothy who was previously one of prime minister Teresa
May's advisers and it says this the Prime Minister cannot Dodge the
hard questions over Ukraine if war is to go on a war if Britain is to go on a war
footing we must know what our strategy is as it will impact every
policy and the article then
eviscerates the whole plan and I'm going to read extracts from it
um first of all Nick Timothy complains that starma is not being asked enough
questions about his policy and he's absolutely right he says this the Prime
Minister says planning for the Coalition of the Willing is entering the operational phase when military
commanders work out the logistics of deployment but Ukraine remains a war
zone the Russian Constitution now declares Crimea donet lugans hon and
zapar roia parts of Russia but Ukraine still controls territory in the last
four if the war continues or Putin accepts the truce and the resumes
fighting what is the plan and what is the objective Ukraine has more than a
million men underarms well that's what's claims and starma has proposed deploying
more than 10,000 troops from different countries the word is it'll the total
force will be around 30,000 is the suggestion that this small force would
stop Putin if he attacks again or is it to show that an attack with Western
troops in Ukraine would risk a wider War fought by the countries of the Coalition
Europe or NATO is the plan to make this outcome clear clear or leave it
ambiguous if we do threaten War what are the consequences of deploying our troops
Beyond NATO borders Donald Trump says he will not issue an American Security
guarantee Putin says he will not tolerate Western troops in Ukraine and European military and political
leaders admit their capabilities are too limited to fight Russia what resources
do we have to form a credible deterrent is an American guarantee likely or
reliable if the Coalition has a clear objective what is the time SC time scale
for achieving it is this an open-ended commitment to Ukraine that will go on
whatever the cost or need to meet other threats what would be the Rules of
Engagement would the Royal Air Force and Coalition Air Forces defend Ukrainian
airspace doing so would require a willingness to shoot down Russian aircraft and attack missile batteries
risking wider war and we know the Russian modus operandi involves hybrid
Warfare in which plausible deniable plausibly deniable attacks are carried
out so how would we respond to attacks on Coalition Soldiers made by unofficial
operatives acting for Putin sending Coalition troops to Ukraine would of
course raise questions about the future of NATO would deploying resources to
Ukraine come at the price of reducing support Elsewhere on the East European
border NATO member states never allowed Ukraine into the alliance did not deploy
troops during the war and will not allow Kiev to join even
now with ambiguity about the response to Russian attacks on NATO soldiers in
Ukraine the risk of such an attack would be great and the burden of responding would fall
disproportionately on Britain a failure of NATO countries to respond
collectively and indeed a clear statement from some member countries that they would not in these
circumstances being drawn in be drawn into conflict risks undermining NATO
itself and the Article 5 commitment that an AR armed attack against one should be
considered an attack against them all for Britain specifically there are very
serious problems the government says we need to rearm but will our rearmament
program be per driven by the perceived need to send ground troops to Ukraine
which defends a border with Russia almost 1500 mil long or by an assessment
of the wider and more dramatic threats we face and then so to what extent is
deployment to Ukraine driving on new defense policy now all of these are
valid questions and you can see that a heavyweight article has been published
in an important British newspaper which finally raises them and I predict there
will be more articles of this kind and I know Timothy to be an political animal
to his fingertips and I have no doubt at all that this article has been
written with the knowledge that there are other people in the British establishment who think as he does so if
the administration comes out straightforwardly and makes this its
opposition to this plan clear then the plan will die not only
will the Europeans no longer support it but there will be
opposition too much opposition in Britain itself for this plan to be
continued now there's an awful lot more that can be said about this in Britain
today there is a deepening economic crisis um the e economy
contracted in January there is a huge
argument within the British government over spending cuts on disability
benefits there's apparently been a rebellion against starma within the labor candidate cabinet labor MPS are
said to be very unhappy they were not after all as MPS of a normally left-wing
party elected by their constituents to cut their constituents benefits and many of
them are worried and I've already discussed st's
proclivity to spend as much as half his time as prime minister on foreign policy
instead of domestic policy where problems are mounting there's growing
criticism of starma on the left as well there is a long article today in the
guardian by the guardian commentator nazarin Malik which is deeply critical
of starma and says that the mask has basically dropped and this attention to
cut disability benefits proves that he is not as bad as the previous conservative
government was but in some ways even worse
so st's domestic position is
precarious there's been a lot of commentary in Britain about supposed
problems within the Reform Party there's been a dispute between Nigel farage the
leader of the party and one of his MPS who has just been suspended and will
probably be expelled from the party before long this doesn't appear to have Ed
reforms opinion poll ratings and predictions spoke of Reform
performing extremely strongly in the event that there had been local elections in Britain in May
as there should have been those elections have been postponed by the way
well all sorts of interesting reasons have been given for that once upon a
time when I was shall we say more naive about the world than I am today I would
not have challenged those reasons though I would still have found the decision to
postpone elections local elections rather odd in light of what's going on
all over Europe nowadays I have to say I am more cynical
about the postponement of the elections a lot more cynical than I would once
have been but here I'm afraid I'm going to have to choose my words extremely
carefully all I will say is that I noticed that in Romania every single
candidate in the forthcoming presidential election who has expressed
any doubts about Romania's membership of the EU and NATO is been picked off and
is been prevented from standing something I find incredible it goes far beyond gesu himself it shows a complete
lack of faith by the Romanian authorities in their people and it's
shows in my opinion a complete disrespect for normal Democratic
processes anyway we see the same well we see a
postponing of elections in Britain I'm not saying that the two events are the
same but well you're at liberty to draw your own conclusions the point I'm trying to make is that the political
situation in Britain is very very fragile I don't get the sense that there
is huge enthusiasm in Britain for this
plan that starma is trying to impose on us and I think think a
clear statement from the United States is not just overdue but it would be welcomed by many
people here just saying now it could be
as something Brian btic my friend that um there is in fact a plan by the United
States to insert European peacekeepers into Ukraine I think that would be with fire
if Putin could in some way be persuaded to agree to that which I don't believe
he would would be well I think that would put Putin in a much more difficult position
that he has ever been in since he became president to the point
where he might not he might for the first time face a real challenge I don't
believe Putin is going to AG agree to something like this all the signals from Russia are saying otherwise if butin is
not going to agree to this if the Russian stance remains firm as I firmly
expect it will then if this thing goes ahead if Donald Trump thinks that he can
go ahead I would not be surprised if come say the end of the year when those
British and French troops do move into Ukraine we might find ourselves in a
situation where the uh 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis would look like well shall I say
a containable problem compared to what we might face anyway this is my program
