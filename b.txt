all right Alexander let's uh talk about the tariff war between the United States
and uh and China and um the the tariff war is escalating it
is uh escalating and it does look like the tariff war has been
uh taken over by a certain neocon uh a neocish let's say faction in uh in the
Trump administration and uh they are pushing the the Trump policy to get uh
harder and harder against China they're talking about increasing the tariffs to
245% or 25% i don't know what uh what effect that really has at this point why
not make it 500% i don't know but um we we do have reporting from I believe it's
the Wall Street Journal that claims the strategy now
from Bessant is to negotiate with 70
countries and uh I wouldn't even call it negotiations to be quite honest to to
tell 70 countries that that want some sort of a of a trade deal with the United States that the tariffs will be
reduced boost or maybe even uh zeroed out if those countries cut uh ties with
China cut trade with China so it does look like the Trump administration is
moving towards a policy which is very much uh a blockade uh against China and
isolation blockade against China the Wall Street Journal claims that uh the Trump administration uh guys like
Bessent they're doing this in order to to gain leverage over China and bring them to to the negotiating table but
when they say something like that I I just think why not just contact China
you're you're looking to do all the all of these things in order to just get them to to bilateral talks when China
has already signaled China has signaled this that they are open to talks so I mean it seems like the messaging is is
just way off and very confused and China has actually said that the messaging is very uh confused and and they don't
quite understand what uh what the Trump administration is is up to china did say
by the way before you you uh give everybody your thoughts China did say that uh Trump has not been so aggressive
against uh against Xiinping and China but it's been more of the Trump administration that has been very
aggressive towards China so I think that's an interesting statement from uh from China anyway your thoughts on the
trade war well first of all I should say that I actually accept what the Wall
Street Journal article says i think I think this is indeed what has happened i
mean the the information we're getting is that um after the reciprocal tariffs
were imposed not just on China but on lots and lots and lots of different countries and when there were problems
in the financial markets Bessant came along to Trump and said look we got to
do away with these reciprocal tariffs on all of these other countries but let's keep them on China and then let's use
the 90 days to negotiate deals with
other countries that will then isolate China and force them into
negotiations when we can impose basically our own demands upon them now
I think this is true and I think this is consistent with what we know about Scott Vesson um a couple of about two weeks
ago I I saw information which appeared on X by the way about how way back in
2011 um Bessant was already indicating that he was pretty hostile to China from
an economic perspective he thought basically didn't like China he didn't like it economically he rejected
apparently um at the institute where he was working at the time he rejected a
paper that outlined the various strengths and possibilities of the
Chinese economy he was very dismissive of it he was already indicating a certain hostility to China at that time
now this is what I'm I mean you said that this is confusing i I think we can understand we
can explain the confusion very simply by saying that these
tariffs so-called against China that have been imposed on China they are not
actually tariffs anymore they are sanctions we've gone from a policy of
tariffs of protectionism to a policy of sanctioning China and the idea is the
rhetoric is that it is intended to put pressure on China so that China will be
forced to the negotiating table where the United States will be able to
negotiate with China from a position of strength now if you understand these
tariffs of sanctions then does that not already
begin to sound familiar what does the
European Union say about its sanctions against Russia what did the Biden
administration say about its sanctions against Russia exactly the same thing
copy and paste the exact It's copy and paste it's exactly the same policy you
impose sanctions you force the other side into negotiations from a position of strength
and you basically then dictate terms now it has completely spectacularly failed
against Russia but if you remember I think it was about two years ago we did
a program when we talked about the very first sanctions that had been imposed on
some Chinese officials and we said in that program that the United States is
on an escalatory escalator with sanctions against China and the iron
rule of sanctions is when you get onto that escalatory escalator you can't get
off it takes you all the way up and it seems to me that's exactly where we are
with China and we now have um all of these attempts to try to isolate China
from the rest of the world economy isn't that exactly what the Biden people the
neocons in the Biden people tried to do with Russia all those threats of
secondary sanctions or this constant movement towards more and more
secondary sanctions against more and more countries to try to isolate Russia
from the world the global economy and again that didn't work with Russia but it's being tried all over again with
China except you don't call it sanctions you call it tariffs so you say to
countries uh around the world if you don't agree with us about China if you
don't take steps with us to isolate China we will tariff you that sounds to
me exactly like the same policy of secondary t of secondary sanctions
that's been applied against Russia all over again and you know it shouldn't
surprise us because it's quite obvious to me that there is indeed a very
powerful neocon faction within the Trump administration this has allied itself
with some sections of the MAGA movement that don't like China for for reasons I
can understand by the way I mean I I understand why people from industrial
regions in the United States who've seen their industries close and who struggle
against Chinese competition might have a particular animous against China but to
repeat again this is not a protectionist industrial policy anymore now when you
understand that everything else it seems to me becomes clear and it also becomes clear why you get uh brief cutouts of
san uh you know tariffs just as with Russian sanctions they allowed
themselves to trade in certain types of goods from Russia oil LNG for a certain
point in time though the pressure to go on impo imposing more and more sanctions
on trade in those goods was always there so you know oil for example initially
um was not affected by the original sanctions that were imposed in February
2022 and then we got the oil price gap and then we've got more um oil um oil
restrictions in the United States and then eventually in Europe as well and all of that and we see the same with uh
um certain types of Chinese goods which are needed in the US market so um you
lift tariffs on certain types of electronic goods but ultimately you're
making it pretty clear that your ultimate intention is to slap tariffs on those as well all you're what you're
trying to do in the meantime is either localize production or try to find some
means round and eventually the the pressure will grow so we've gone from an
economic policy which is one I can understand and relate to to a
geopolitical policy which is not very different from some of the geopolitical
policies that we have seen in the past and I I have to say I'm concerned about
this and I wonder whether the president himself Donald Trump who I think on the
contrary is somebody who is a genuine protectionist and believes in protection
quite understands what has happened to his policy that it has been distorted in
this kind of way um which um ultimately will negate its its
underlying effectiveness right you go from a policy of uh of saying you want to
re-industrialize you want to protect uh American industry uh you want you want
fair trade uh deals you want fair trade balances all
understandable all of it it's understandable uh how you get there that's that's another video oh and of
course uh you have many analysts who who all take different approaches as you how to get there or if that's even possible
if re-industrialization is even possible anymore that's that's a different topic
the the problem that the Trump administration has and I agree with you is that they started off with with
protecting US industry re-industrialization fair trade deals and now it's drifted towards sanctions
against uh China with Russia they
started provoked a proxy war and then the sanctions came with the goal of
regime change yes in Russia that was the goal remove Putin so you start the proxy
war then you pile on 60,000 plus sanctions on Russia you hope for the the
Putin government to collapse and all is good if you're the collective west that was the
thinking what's the end goal with China you're starting off you you start
with tariffs at first you say you're going to you're going to impose tariffs liberation day and tariffs they've
morphed into sanctions you're now trying to get other countries on board
secondary sanctions to sanction China so that's it's as you say secondary sanctions so you're trying to get other
countries on board you don't have a proxy war or a hot war
as you did with Russia is that the next step and what is the end goal i mean is
is it regime change in China because that's that's not going to happen yes is it something else is it trying to put
China in in its place to weaken China what is the end goal in all this because Russia the end goal was I mean
we called out the end goal after 3 months once the sanctions were were put on Russia you know we did many videos we
said okay that's that's the purpose to all of this well to sink the Russian economy and to remove Putin and and
Biden said as much what what is the end goal here with China well let let's first of all start with the whole let's
unpack all the points that you make you're absolutely right we're not yet involved in a proxy conflict with China
I absolutely absolutely believe now that that is coming it is only a question of time before we have some kind of a
military conflict and you see this in Taiwan you the the the new president
there has been making incredibly strong comments about China he's referred to
China as a foreign country which is an absolute red line for the government in
Beijing so again very much as in Ukraine a
completely unnecessary crisis is being provoked now can I just say here I want
to just say something about Taiwan it's always presented as a zero sum game do
you want Taiwan to fall completely under Beijing's control or do you want to have
Taiwan as an independent state it seems to me that there was a completely
workable compromise that worked very very well for decades and which the
Chinese were showing no signs of being unhappy with or wanting to change which
is that Taiwan continues to function as in effect a kind of de facto independent
state it maintains all kinds of economic contacts and political contacts at a
certain level with pretty much every country in the world but it does so um
if you like under the fiction that it is a part of China now the Chinese were
perfectly happy with that they had good economic relations with Taiwan throughout that period in fact Taiwan
was becoming very active and in very heavily involved in the Chinese economy and this really wasn't an issue if you
go back 10 15 years there was simply no issue about Taiwan but now this whole
issue of Taiwan is being increasingly brought up there's talk about independence the new president who's
taken over from the previous pro-independence president seems even more keen to push forward with this and
and essentially is talking about independence in a way which is going to
provoke Beijing it's it's inevitably going to um the Chinese have said this
is a red line for them they're taking military steps to prevent it and well
it's difficult to see how if there's going to be a military clash over between China and Taiwan that
the United States is not going to be involved now people who say that what
will then happen will not be a proxy war and that for that reason it's
different from say Ukraine should go back and read that New York Times
article about the war in Ukraine which we discussed because ultimately it's now
clear the war in Ukraine was also not a proxy war it was a war in which the
United States was directly involved on a much bigger scale than it admitted
you're talking about the New York Times article from two two weeks ago with the German command center exactly that's
what you're referencing exactly the Vbarden command center and all that so you know we we we are drifting into
exactly the same scenario only this time it's difficult to see how the United
States will be able to conceal its involvement in the same way that to a certain extent it managed to do in
Ukraine so it we are heading towards this now um so that
already is very alarming but what is the ultimate endgame well one part of the
endgame obviously is to prevent China from becoming an economic rival to the
United States building up alternative economic relationships to those of the
United States superseding the United States as the dominant player of the world economy all of that but I think in
the end if you manage to get some of the people who promote this policy to one
side and talk to them one for one it's quite obvious to me that the ultimate objective again is regime change in
China that is what it is all all about i mean if you listen to the rhetoric they
use about um the Chinese government about the Communist Party of China about
Cining in particular um the ultimate end go end goal is the same now it it it
failed disastrously in Russia putin is there
stronger than ever more popular than ever i'm sure it's going to fail in
exactly the same way in China but as we've discussed so many times in so many
programs these people don't have a reverse care they when they start on
these policies they they cannot ever give them up and we are on a
steady push towards escalation now in in
terms of Ukraine Donald Trump has come in and he's put this to he's I mean to
take his enormous credit the one thing he's managed to do with Ukraine is he's brought this whole thing to a stop and
show sign of wanting to reverse it what I don't think he appreciates is that he
is on the same trajectory with China as the Biden people were in Ukraine i don't
think he is fully sold on this policy and maybe just possibly when he
understands that this is where he this is going he will put it he will put a
stop on it also but he needs to understand or somebody needs to explain
to him that this is exactly where this is going and that that is the objective
that ultimately uh these people are aiming
for i it is the only logical end point for their policies if their policies
were ever to be successful which of course they cannot be uh Bloomberg is
saying Chinese officials are confused by conflicting signals from Washington while Trump's tone on Chinese President
Xiinping has been moderate hawkish comments from other highranking White
House officials have conflicted without a clear and consistent US position China
sees little value in engagement it's basically China saying "Look we
we're okay if we sit down with you and we we talk about a managed controlled
divorce." Yeah a decoupling whatever you want to call it a soft landing you know
let's let's let's go our separate ways but let's manage it yes and then we
can completely you know be be separate maybe a little trade here and there but
we're fine with it but let's manage this thing and it seems as if the Chinese realize that Trump has
one vision of of of where he wanted to go which was as you stated as we stated
uh protecting US industry re-industrialization etc but they also seem to understand that hawkish that's
the word that they use hawkish forces in inside the administration have taken over and now this thing is going in a
completely different direction correct yeah is isn't there someone in the Trump
administration that also understands it understands this if the if the Chinese understand this you got to imagine that there are people in the Trump
administration who understand this and they can bring Trump the president back into into focus of of where he wanted to
go with liberation day yes well exactly i mean can I I think there are very
intelligent people in the Trump administration that's the first thing to say i I think that over time they will
begin to understand this and I'm hoping that we will eventually see the brakes
being put on can I just repeat again uh if this is a policy for rebuilding
American industry and using protection to do it then that is a you know that is
a worthy objective and I am not somebody who is in principle opposed to the use
of tariffs i can understand the point about what that kind of protectionism is
all about but notice some of the rhetoric that is being now used it's
about stopping Chinese predatory economic policies not
just against the United States but all other countries uh the UNi they're
talking about in other words blocking Chinese trade with everybody I which makes it
clearly a geopolitical project now it's not going to work it cannot work far too
many countries rely upon depend on China now for their trade and anyway I'm not
even sure that this is put aside any you know you know the morals of this uh uh
policy uh sorry whether it's workable as a policy economically which I don't think it is i'm not sure that it's even
a you know ethical policy frankly imposing an economic blockade of this
kind against one particular country in this kind of way but all right leave
leave that aside the focus should be on the United
States itself by all means have tariffs if that's what you think is going to
work you can have 10% flat tariffs and you can put in stronger tariffs to
protect particular industries as has already happened with automobiles with
coal with steel with aluminium whatever whatever you think needs particular
protection you can have tariffs which apply against all
trading countries to protect American industry you can develop a program to
develop American industry behind those tariff barriers exactly as was the case
in the 19th century that is a a policy it may not be one that most economists
would agree with but it is a policy and it has an objective and I'm not myself
going to come and simply say it's going to fail um before it's tried but but and
China can't object to that because China cannot object to it it's the US's sovereign right to to do these things to
do these things exactly i Well you can you they will say the World Trade Trade Organization but who pays any attention
to that anymore to be to to to say it bluntly but you know it it is a policy china cannot object to it but don't try
in that case to interfere with China's trade with other countries as well and the United States is every um all of the
things are in place to enable the United States to
rebuild its industrial economy in that way it has a massive consumer market
still the biggest in the world even though it's now only 30% of world demand
but that is still enormous demand there is huge demand for goods in the United
States you can you can rebuild America
the industries of America in that sort of way but the risk you run if you
convert this into an economic war is that you will lose your focus on that
you will stop thinking about the people in the industrial towns and coal mines
in Pennsylvania in all of the other industrial places of the United States because you will become drawn into a
long drawn out economic war which will then become a geopolitical war and
perhaps ultimately a a military struggle with China the most powerful adversary
you have ever taken on since the end of the Second World War and in the meantime
all of those places in the United States which you set out to try and help will
just continue to rot because you're going to have to win over friends to around the world you're going
to look look for allies to uh um help you fight this geopolitical struggle
with uh China and how are you going to do that well Scott Bessant is already uh
indicating the way you're going to do it you're going to cut trade deals which are going to be favorable to those
friends and they will then take advantage of that to export their goods
into the United States so instead of being faced with Chinese imports you're
going to have e imports from Europe from ex you know from wherever South Korea
Thailand whatever country i I'm not saying any particular country well
you're going to lose focus on re-industrialization in the United States you're going to sacrifice the
American economy again to the pursuit of this geopolitical struggle so it it is
ultimately self-defeating yeah I agree
uh spheres of influence end globalism he ended globalism trump ended
globalism in a way re-industrialized the United States stay focused yes stay
focused on these things the minute it becomes a geopolitical project it it turns into a disaster it really does
remind me of the European Union in a way as well you know the European Union
started out very good yeah movement of of labor um movement of of of capital
and an economic union all is good for the benefit of the of the member states
of the EU and it turned into a geopolitical freaking nightmare
exactly and that's that's that's what could happen with with all of this in in the United States they need to stop
pursuing these geopolitical uh initiatives it doesn't do anyone any
good especially the American people it doesn't do the American people any good he did absolutely i I I would the the
starting point for any policy of protectionism I I would say is to go
back to the president the American who for me
remains by far the greatest American president who actually in many respects
initiated the program of protectionism who was Lincoln most people have shown
very little interest in Lincoln's economic policies in the 1860s but he
was the person who basically launched the United States on the program of protection and who created the um
framework for the industrialization of America and for the agricultural
development of America as well anyway go to his last speech his last public
speech his second inaugural address which you know the last passage which starts with the words you know with
malice towards none with charity for all but it ends with the words that they
would that America would seek a just and lasting peace with ourselves and all
nations and that ought to be the policy that was what Lincoln understood if
you're going to develop the United States you need peace you don't look for
enemies all over the place there were many people in the United States at that time who were looking for enemies and by
the way Britain was the was the country that they were talking about at that time lincoln said "Forget all about that
we impose protection we defend American industry we build it up and we engage in
a massive program of industrialization and economic development and
administrations that followed uh um pursued his policies and the result was
that the American the United States became the economic colossus that it was
by the beginning of the 20th century i have you know that is where a policy of
protectionism should begin a pol a just and lasting peace with ourselves and all
nations all right we will end the video there the durand.locals.com we are on rumble
