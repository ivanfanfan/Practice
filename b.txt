all right Alexander let's do an update
on the USChina tariff uh war and uh it
does look like we are starting to get
statements from from both the US and
from China that uh we could be moving
towards some sort of uh deescalation
um I'm not quite sure how significant of
a deescalation is going to be i'm not
sure if we're getting any closer closer
to some sort of of a bilateral
negotiation which I imagine is the
ultimate goal is to get both sides at
the table so they can discuss uh how to
move forward how how to move towards a
managed divorce I think is the best
outcome yes uh what are your thoughts on
on where we're going with the tariff
absolutely i think that is exactly
what's happened no I mean there are uh a
lot of reports circulating in the media
um including the British media by the
way that within two weeks time there
will start to be vis visible shortages
of goods in US stores and this is now
putting pressure on Trump i don't know
whether that's true could be and there
are also other reports that Chinese
factories have stopped production again
probably true but again the extent to
which that's is true is difficult to say
but we've had the first comment from
Trump he speaks about the fact that um
China and the United States are going to
uh uh see tariffs reduced he importantly
he accepted he acknowledged that the
current tariffs are unsustainable which
is of course what we have been saying
for the last two or three weeks um but
he he's accepted that you know the
current tariffs that China and the
United States have against each other
are are just unsustainable he said the
tariffs will come down they won't come
back down back to where they were before
he was president i don't think anybody
accepts that i don't think anybody in
China accepts that it looks to me as if
he's trying to work his way towards a
policy of protection which is what we
have been talking about you can agree
with it you can disagree with it but a
policy of protection to protect US
manufacturing industry to bring growth
back away from the kind of outright
economic war which we have been seeing
develop over the last few weeks oh there
were important comments from Trump now
the Chinese have been making statements
of their own and here I'm afraid there's
been a great deal of misdirection
because um there was a claim that the
Chinese said that only they would only
talk after the United States
rescended all unilateral tariffs in
other words all tariffs that Trump has
imposed since he became president back
in J in January now I've scoured the
Chinese media and the Chinese foreign
ministry and other government websites
to find confirmation of that i haven't
found it anywhere it appears to derive
from some words said by one official
what the Chinese are saying and what the
Chinese officially are saying is yes we
are prepared to talk we're prepared to
talk on an equal basis i mean they
clearly are not prepared to make massive
concessions but they're certainly
prepared to talk and I'm going to make a
guess i think at some point within the
next two weeks we will see a proper
negotiation start to get underway and
the first steps will be taken to start
to bring the tariffs
down what would that mean as far as uh
as as the escalation that has already
taken place the 100 145% 125% are we
going back
to to the to the baseline to the 10% or
the 20% and then they're going to work
things out from there or I I I I I
suspect that Trump is going to go down
to 20% i think that's probably where
this is going actually i don't which
which I think the Chinese can can live
with i mean they won't like it but I
think they can live with it there will
probably be some reciprocal tariffs from
China as well uh but I mean the point is
trade can happen at that level it can't
happen when tariffs are at 145% or
anything of that kind but it's a massive
economic shock that we have seen and as
you as you completely said it's
basically um it will basically be clear
that you know the tariff moves that have
happened over the last uh few weeks was
China and uh the United States serving
on each other the economic divorce
papers because that's what it looks like
but at that point we we are we are into
a situation of protecting American
industry it is no longer an economic war
it is no longer a project to
um destabilize China and crush its
economy um and I think one of the
reasons by the
way why we've seen a softening of the
American approach is not just because
um all these reports
about goods starting to run out in
American stores there may be some of
that going on but I think the major
reason is that um the
sculpcent idea that countries around the
world would rally to the United States
and that China would be economically
isolated that just didn't happen didn't
happen yeah and and getting it getting
to the bilateral agreements with other
countries whether it be uh India which
already had an agreement that they were
working on before the uh the liberation
day yes um Japan South Korea all these
countries it was taking time i I think u
the Trump administration maybe Bessant
wasn't aware of this i find it hard to
believe but but who knows u maybe they
didn't understand that trade agreements
are not hammered out in in a couple of
weeks they can take many months to years
yes that's under that's and that's under
ideal circumstances that's under
friendly uh circumstances so all of all
of this stuff was was taking time and it
wasn't working out no the way they
thought it was uh it was going to be so
is the US also going to
to remove the
um the demand that countries don't trade
with China and is China going to to to
take back their warnings
uh two countries if they did agree to
the US's demands to not trade with China
this whole reciprocal warning thing that
was going on so all of that is going to
likely go away yes I think so because as
I said it hasn't worked i mean Shinping
has had a very successful trip in
Southeast Asia he's visited various AAN
countries he visited Vietnam Malaysia
and um Cambodia and you know he seems to
have been very well received there jd
Vance has been in India i think that the
Indians will have told JD Vance
um look you know we we have our issues
with China and they're very difficult
and they're very important and we do
want to have very good relations with
you but it is simply not practical for
India to cut off trade with China in the
way that you say china is now India's
biggest trading partner it is a vital
investor in the Chinese economy in the
Indian economy it is providing India
with infrastructure investment which
India absolutely needs if it is going to
grow its economy further and it has
expertise to do it i mean I've been in
discussions with people about this india
simply cannot afford this kind of
economic cut off with China that some
people in the United States might have
thought so um I I think that we will see
that you know these demands from the
United States to stop dealing with China
are going to gradually fade out they
probably won't be
publicly pulled back but the reality is
the Americans will stop talking about
them when they undertake these
absolutely rightly as you rightly say
very very complex trade
negotiations um the Chinese won't
publicly take back their warnings but
their warnings won't be needed any
further and as I said we'll be back
finally to that position that arguably
we should have been in in the first
place where the United States pursues
moves towards a
protectionist trade policies which as I
said you can disagree with but they have
a long history they're nothing
fundamentally new and they have their
advocates and you know for all I know
they might even work i'm not saying they
will uh but you know it is a viable
economic policy or at least an economic
policy that has a strong intellectual
underpinning so the United States can do
that and China and the United States can
pursue this economic divorce that we
were talking about when Trump was
president during his first term and
which seemed to be progressing at that
time until his presidency was completely
derailed um um two years in after the
Democrats gained control of the House
and everything began to go completely
wrong with Russia Gate and all of that
so I I I think that you know if nothing
else this has been a this has had a
galvanizing effect but we're starting to
see a return to a more stable um a more
stable course than the one that we've
seen over the last um few weeks and a
more sustainable one uh off topic but
maybe not off topic maybe not off topic
I'll ask you um and probably uh a video
that we're going to that we're
definitely going to record at another
time but um the tensions between India
and Pakistan do you think they're
connected in any way
to to the uh the tariff war the the
tariff conflict between the US and China
do you think there are other forces at
work here um just just a quick just for
a quick analysis there and as I said was
we'll get into depth on this topic in
another video but we absolutely will it
does it does seem that there there could
be some some sort of connection there
with everything that's going on in the
world trying to to escalate to stir up
escalation between um India and Pakistan
and we had an interesting statement from
the Pakistani defense minister who did
say that this was some sort of he hinted
at he hinted at the fact that this could
have been a false flag and he did say
that Pakistan has been doing the the
dirty work of of the United States for
decades something along those lines is
what he said um interesting statement
from the very interesting statement i
have I have absolutely no doubt at all
that this is what is his or connected to
none at all but as you rightly say this
is something we do need to talk about
more in much more depth i I I should say
that the next couple of days following
this program will show the ex our making
of this program this will show whether
or not the situation between Pakistan
and India which is incredibly dangerous
by the way remember they're both nuclear
powers whether it will escalate um the
rhetoric from both sides is very strong
and the actions that each side has been
taking against the other so far has also
been very strong it it clearly I have no
doubt about this it would not have
happened had we not had this enormous
crisis between the United States on the
one side and China on the other india is
a kind of ally well it's it's it's got a
strong partnership both with
Pakistan and now with India it's
historical connection has been closer to
Pakistan's than it has been with India
india historically was an ally or a
friend of the Soviet Union but Pakistan
also has a very close relationship
indeed with China which is in some ways
even more important for Pakistan than
the one with the United States is so
undoubtedly all of this is
interconnected and it plays a
significant role but I think we need to
have a better idea of where all this
crisis is going because flare-ups and
tensions between India and Pakistan are
very common this one looks like it could
be worse than some of the others that we
have
seen but um I think a proper analysis of
it needs as you correctly say a
dedicated program and perhaps a better
perspective where the timing of it the
timing the timing is there's no I mean
there is no coincidence here let me put
it like that yeah okay we will end the
