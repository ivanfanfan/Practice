good day today is Sunday 8th March 2025 and somewhat unusually for our recent
programs I'm going to start by discussing the military situation on the Ukrainian battle lines because according
to reports reports that are now appearing both in the um Russian
Ukrainian and by the way the Western media things over the last couple of
days have taken a dramatic turn firstly a couple of days ago about uh um 36 to
48 hours ago the Russians began um a new major
missile strike across Ukraine a strike involving missiles
drones Hypersonic missiles perhaps certainly ballistic missiles but both
air launched cruise missiles launched from tupal f95 bomb that's to say
k101 missiles and calibra missiles launched from U Russian Navy ships in
the Black Sea now according to the ukrainians something like 70 missiles
were launched all together so this was a big strike though not one of the biggest but it was a big strike and of course
there's also been drones operating used as well now the Russian defense Ministry
has given its usual rather Bland account of the strike it says the Russian Armed
Forces launched a group strike by high Precision long range airc and
groundbased weapons as well as unmanned aerial vehicles of the gas and power
infrastructure that supported the Ukrainian defense industry Enterprises
the goal of the strike was achieved all the targets were
engaged just to make one quick Point here which is that notice that the Russians
are now talking about the gas supply in infrastructure previous Russian missile
strikes the ones that basically started in the Autumn of 2022 targeted the electricity generation
system now the Russians have expanded the range of targets that they're
attacking to Encompass the Ukrainian gas supply system
as well this is a consequence of president zelinsky's decision at the
beginning of J January of this year to cease uh to end or rather not to renew
the transit agreement between the the um Russian gas export Monopoly um gas
prom and the Ukrainian gas trans trans
it Monopoly and gas supplier after gas so the Russians no longer Supply gas to
Ukraine and as a result they now see the gas supply system as fair game and they
begun to attack it they began to attack it sporadically over the course of the
winter but now that they are now they're doing this more purposefully now this
missile Strike should be understood as the start of Russia's um missile
campaign for the rest of the spring and summer of
2025 um in 2022 2023 the Russian the Russians conducted
missile strikes against the Ukrainian Energy System over the course of the
winter but starting from the spring of 2023
they were mostly focused on attacking they have mostly focused in their
attacks in what John Helmer has referred to as the electricity War they mostly
conducted their attacks in the um lighter weather the more summ weather of
Spring and Summer and Early Autumn now I'm not sure why this is the case but I
would just say that um the Russian foreign minister Sergey lavro apparently told the Americans when he
met with them in ariad about 10 days ago that this was intentionally done to
avoid hardship to Ukraine's civilian population many people will of course be
deeply cynical about that explanation but it is what it is anyway there we are
that's that's the start of the Russian
spring summer missile Campaign which is likely to continue until my guess is mid
AUM that was what happened last year it was what also happened by the way in
2023 I don't see why this year should be any different always assuming of course
that we don't get a sensation of hostilities in the meantime now the
interesting thing about this particular missile strike is that even the Western media are
conceding that most of the missiles or at least a large part of the missiles
got through and this has been linked to
the American decision to stop providing intelligence to
Ukraine and the point that's been made is that whenever the Russians have launched a missile strike against
Ukraine in the past the ukrainians have been
given advanced notice of it because the Americans through their various um
intelligence systems that surveillance aircraft their drones they're very
Advanced drones and of course their enormous system of satellites and well all the other
enormous tools that the Americans possess to conduct surveillance on
Russia anyway the Americans have been able to give the ukrainians several hours advanced warning that a strike of
that kind is coming and they've been able to give the ukrainians some idea of
where the Russian heavy bombers are located the ukrainians are also informed
in advance when the Mig 31s take off with their kou Hypersonic Miss s and
well that has given Ukraine's air defense at least some ability to prepare
for the Russian attacks which the ukrainians have put to use earlier in
the war by the way just to make one quick observation about this
the fact that the Americans have apparently been providing this intelligence and it's been now disclosed
again in the media in the west um brings home the fact of what a
strange war in some respects this particular War has been because if there
was an allout war between Russia and the United States between the Russians and
the Western Powers well one would assume that in that case the Russians would act
very very quickly to do what they can in fact do
which is um close down this American
surveillance system which operates to the extent it does in this
war because the United States and Russia are technically not at War not at War
though as I said this has to be understood in a very qualified way
because as I discussed in my program two days ago in practice this is not a proxy
war between the United States and the Russians it is BAS better
understood as a kind of Coalition war between the west and Russia in which
Ukraine has been doing the actual fighting Ukrainian soldiers have been doing the actual fighting but in which
the United States has been providing everything else the intelligence the equipment the command and control the
communications even much of the battlefield planning just saying anyway
the point is on this occasion a lot of the missiles did get through and this is causing considerable dismay in Ukraine
the ukrainians are also complaining that they are now desperately short again of
patriot missile interceptors this has been a long running story um
Ukraine finds itself short of patriot missile interceptors it pleads with the
United States for the United States to supply more the Americans U scravel
around to find whatever spare Patriot missile interceptors are left they're
then sent to Ukraine Ukraine then uses them for a couple of weeks and the story
then resumes the ukrainians are now saying that they depend on the Americans
for around 50% of their air defense missiles the
Europeans are pro able to provide a quarter and the remaining quarter is
made up of old Soviet Legacy systems that the ukrainians still have left a
few s3000s and other systems of that kind
behind so Patriots have been the the core of the American Supply and they are
again in short supply in Ukraine now bear in mind that in the last weeks of the Biden
Administration uh missiles and other military equipment
were rushed to Ukraine that was just a few weeks ago the Biden administration
of only um left office on the 20th of January um just over as I said six six
seven weeks ago now but in spite of that in spite of the fact that reports um as
I remember at the time was saying that the US was sending as many Patriot
missile interceptors to Ukraine as it could with many of them apparently donated by Israel which has um found
that it can develop its own substitutes to some of these Patriots anyway in that
relatively short time the ukrainians have run through their Stop Bar of
patriot missile interceptors they're now very very short of these again and well
we see that the Russians are coming um even though during the during the winter
as I said the Russian missile campaign was not under away in any serious way
and not in the way that it is now but apparently the Russians were doing enough to ensure that the ukrainians ran
through their stock barile of patriot missile interceptors but it is the loss
of intelligence for the United States that has again dismay them and it means that Ukraine is now
open or more open to attack by Russian
missiles than it has been before because it doesn't have the advanced warning of
Russian missile strikes that it used to have so that's that's one event that
took place and as I said it's caused real alarm in Ukraine but it is
completely overshadowed by the unfolding mil
military disaster that is now taking place in Kos region now if we just
recapitulate the story of Kos region um the ukrainians zilinski syi
and almost certainly budanov launched this allout offensive into Kos region
back in August I remember the Euphoria in the western media at the time even
though one did see squirel in uh various protestations from various Western
governments that they'd not been given advanced warning of the fact and that they didn't really understand what it
was that the ukrainians was supposed to be doing we know now that that was not
true we now know a great deal about the extent to which the West has been
directly engaged in operational planning of Ukrainian
um military moves and as I've just does in many programs and as was disclosed some weeks
ago some months ago in the US media I think it was in the New York Times there
was in fact a meeting in April of last year in Washington where the Ukrainian
senior Ukrainian Intelligence Officers including one must assume kirila budanov
turned up informed the Americans that Ukraine was losing the war that if the
war continued in the same conventional way that it had been doing then Ukraine
would eventually lose and a decision was made then that is to say in April
2024 that some kind of asymmetric approach needed to be
taken um in order to prevent this Ukrainian defeat and I've discussed how
that partly inv involved assassinations of people inside Russia it also involved
the Ukrainian drone offensive on targets inside
Russia it also came to involve the
strikes with American British and French missiles inside Russia as well the
attacks the storm shadows and the scalps though those didn't begin in earnest
until November um and um it also involved this
operation in Kos region and as I have discussed in in program after program as
I discussed at the time at the time when this Ukrainian operation in Kos region
was already underway was actually underway I said that the obvious
objective the only objective that made sense in terms of this
Ukrainian attack on K region was the kusk nuclear power plant and it was
clear to me that the ukrainians were aiming to seize it and then to use it as
a as a bargaining chip in order to extract significant concessions from the Russians up to and including perhaps um
surrendered by the Russians back to Ukraine of the zapar roia nuclear power
plant and I discussed at the time that in fact this operation failed within the
first 5 days the ukrainians got bogged down in
the first week of the operation in fighting in the small town of suja 11
kilomet from the border the only important place they were able to
capture that gave the Russians sufficient time to organize the defenses
around the kusk nuclear power plant Russian forces some of them perhaps
already deployed to the area in anticipation of the attack there
continues to be a theory that the Russians always knew all along what the ukrainians were likely to do and
basically set a trap for them I'm not going to discuss that further in this program but anyway the Russians in the
first five days and definitely by the first two weeks had brought the
Ukrainian Advance into K under control and after that it's been the
usual Battle of attrition um zalinski as he always does he had apparently hatched
the plan to strike at cus all all the way back in February though February
2024 though um it seems that he didn't go for
it until presumably this permission was obtained from the Western allies maybe
following that meeting of intelligence Chiefs in Washington in April of last
year anyway zalinski despite the fact that the
operation failed that it failed to capture the nuclear power plant the K
nuclear power plant that all that it managed was to leave Ukraine in control
of one small town of about 6,000 people which is suja and a
scattered uh group of in some cases very small
villages in an area with poor roads with hills and forests and streams anyway
despite all of that zalinski insisted that the Ukrainian troops must
stay he said that the K Corporation was a success a great success it had
supposed to it has supposedly diverted Russian troops from other places where
they were on the offensive though nobody could say quite where those other places
were and in fact the Russian Advance at that time in Don
Bas actually accelerated anyway that was what zalinski said and that he came up with
more rationalizations and explanations he then started to say when it became clear
that the operation in K was not achieving any military objectives that
he was achieving important long-term political objectives because as he said
only about three or four weeks ago um the territory in KK
was a Ukrainian bargaining chip when negotiations with Russia began the
ukrainians would be able to swap it for other territory that the Russians had captured a proposition which I have
always said was absurd and which the Russians have comprehensive
ridiculed and in a program I did about three weeks ago four weeks ago I said
that this statement of zalinskis in effect meant that the
Ukrainian troops in K would not be withdrawn from Kos despite the fact that
Kos was turning into a graveyard for the Ukrainian Army and that the area that
the ukrainians controlled in kusk was being Whitted down by the Russians day
by day until at the time when zalinski said it it had been reduced to around
40% of its former size I said that zalinski by making statements like that
by insisting that Kus must be held on the territory in kosua must be held on
as a bargaining ship was in effect preventing the ukrainians from
organizing an orderly withdraw of their troops from kosk region and that as a
result he was dooming the Ukrainian troops in Kos region to their fate well
that's exactly where we now are because the reports say that the Russians have
indeed managed to to bring the main Supply road to the forces the Ukrainian
forces in kosk now essentially confined
to the town of suja that the Russians now have the supply
line the main supply line under their Fire Control they've reached it or at
least they've come close to it in multiple places their drones and their
shell and their mortars and their anti-tank missiles and their artillery
are able to control long stretches of this road making it incredibly difficult
for the ukrainians to keep their force in suja supplied and yesterday reports started
to appear all across the media starting with a report from
Reuters that in fact the ukrainians in suja are essentially surr landed and
this has started to appear even in the mainstream media so we've had an article
like this in the Daily Telegraph 10,000 Ukrainian troops at risk of
encirclement and Putin's forces Advance on vital supply line after us stops
sharing intelligence with Kiev that is grously false by the way the Russians
reached the supply line or at least established fire control over the supply
line before Donald Trump before the Americans Switched Off the
intelligence it the one event has no
connection at all with the other just saying but anyway the Daily Telegraph
then goes on to say 10,000 Ukrainian troops are at risk of encirclement after Russia broke through
the front lines and advanced on a key supply line from two directions as I
said if You' been listening to programs on this channel you would have known that this actually started to happen
about two weeks ago Vladimir for Putin's forces advanced in suja 11 kilometers
inside Russia crossing the border into Ukraine's Sumi ablast from the north
North on Friday in fact again just to say Putin confirmed that the Russians
had crossed into Sumi region several days before Friday again the Daily Telegraph is not
getting its information from Russian sources it gets its information exclusively from Ukrainian sources as as
Reuters and all of the others and the result is that they're
either badly misinformed or they are several days or sometimes weeks behind
the event and then um we're then told that it is believed that a significant number of North Korean troops were used
in the offensive to cut the Ukrainian soldiers off with the help of drone Warfare to disrupt Kiev Supply chains
and Logistics the claim about the significant number of North Korean soldiers comes of course from DS the
Ukrainian mapping project once one of the most reliable sources of
information about the state of the battlefronts but closed down briefly by
the ukrainians um some months ago um it went offline and it's clear that it's since
then it's been brought under tighter control by the Ukrainian authorities and
it now spreads this kind of information anyway
the article then says that a junior Sergeant communicating with the Daily Telegraph via sporadic phone connection
said Ukraine was considering withdrawing from kusk to avoid further losses we want to avoid losses the fear of
encirclement is real well that was yesterday um there's been more reports
today and um there's a report from Russian sources which say that
the ring around the Ukrainian troops in Kos region around suja has tightened
further and well we've had some confirmation of this from the Russian defense Ministry the Russian def defense
Ministry has said that a village novaya
Sorina and two other villages in that area this is this is north of of suja
have now all passed under Russian control there are reports this morning
that the ukrainians have abandoned retreated from the village of Malaya
loia north of suja and that the Russians are about to
regain control of Malaya Loa and well if
you look at a map of the territory that the ukrainians
still control in this area on the assumption that it is indeed the case
that um the ukrainians have withdrawn from Malaya logia well it is now just a
small cluster of villages very very close to suja itself so the main road
into suja is cut that's what the media in the west are telling us with the 10
to 12,000 troops that the ukrainians supposedly have in suja U reuter by the
way says that the Ukrainian forces in Kos region have been cut in two I'm not
clear where that has happened but I I'm not going to explore this but anyway um
that the Ukrainian troops in K region are now
basically confined to sua itself and a few small villages
clustered around it the most important of which is a village called Kaz kacha L
which is located just immediately north of
suja and that there is no way that the ukrainians can break out that they are
in effect trapped in suja and there's even reports this
morning that the Russians have begun the first assaults on suja itself and that
some Ukrainian troops in suja aware that they're now cut off with their
Communications also cut off and under immense pressure from the Russians that
some Ukrainian troops are already negotiating the terms of their surrender
now these are just reports and we mustn't rush to conclusions and assume
that these reports are all in every detail true but they might be and well
here again we see the price Ukraine has been paying
for conducting its War the actual fighting on the
battlefronts as a kind of public relations campaign because there was
ample opportunity in the past to withdraw the troops from kosk region
given as I said that the operation the key purpose of the operation which is clearly the capture of the K nuclear
power plant was not achieved in August there was no point in keeping the
Ukrainian troops longer in Kos region they could have been withdrawn then and
the entire force would have been preserved but a lot what could have been said about how a successful raid had
been carried out into Russia and how the Russians had been shaken and distracted
by it but of course it wasn't done and then there were plenty of opportunities to withdraw the Ukrainian troops later
but that wasn't done either and just a few weeks ago zalinski was still talking
about swapping suja for territory inside Ukraine which the Russians had captured
and well exactly as I said that has now apparently left the Ukrainian troops in
suja mostly surrounded and in an extremely
perilous position now I have to say there are reports
which are not fully consistent with each other the Russians are putting the
actual number of Ukrainian troops in suja at between 6 and 8,000 Which is
less than that figure of 10,000 I quoted from The Daily Telegraph or the figure
of 12,000 which earlier appeared from my memory in Reuters so it may be that the number of
Ukrainian troops in the bag is smaller than some of the western media Reports
say unusual for the Russians by the way to give a more moderate account of a
Ukrainian defeat or a crisis for the ukrainians than the Western powers do um
who knows um but anyway some Ukrainian troops do seem
to be in the bag I do strongly suspect that the reports that the ukrainians
have been driven out of Malaya loia are true and as I said that the ring around
suja has closed but I think that the report that the Russians are actually
attacking suja itself or are about to do so may be premature but then what do I
know saying all of this from London I'm not in touch with the soldiers directly
on the battlefronts I'm not there so it may be that I'm wrong about all of these things
but I'm going to say this if a force of 6,000 Ukrainian troops is
defeated or is forced to surrender and Russian Reports say that
even if the ukrainians now try to escape only around 10 to 15% of them would be
able to do so the Trap around them has closed so effectively that it's no
longer the case that most of them could retreat in safety across the roads and
the fields the the uh the country roads and the fields or anything like that
anyway if this is to if we do get into this position then it is the biggest
single defeat the Ukrainian Army has suffered of the course of the entire
military operation the special military operation in Ukraine the ukrainians have
suffered in some ways more consequent itial
defeats the loss of OFA the loss of selo the loss of vad ugad all of these places
but they would not have been trapped in a
cauldron in quite the way that we are seeing now again if these reports are
true and if we do get a surrender of let's say four to 5,000 Ukrainian troops
that's the largest that would be the largest number of Ukrainian troops taken
prisoner at one go by the Russians since the start of the special military
operation one way or the other the ukrainians being driven out of kusk is
going to be a very very heavy psychological blow for the ukrainians and it will damage um zelinsky's
prestige and authority and the
confidence in him of Western governments especially I suspect at this point the
American government but there we are we'll have to wait and see what happens Elsewhere on the battlefronts there was
reports more reports yesterday of the Russians getting much closer now to
finally wrapping up the battle in chuar and the Russians continued their Advance
west of um west of um AA yovo Silka and
selo as they gradually push towards the Nea as for the Ukrainian counter
attacks near pakros and toret um from what I can tell they have
been essentially unsuccessful there's again lots of
claims that the ukrainians are trying to disrupt um a major Russian buildup that
is taking place in this area um the deputy chief of Ukraine's intelligence
Military Intelligence in other words under Budan most senior subordinates
spoke about the Russians um mobilizing another 350,000 men this year at least
not mobilizing but um recruiting another 350,000 men and
how they're um been spending the last couple of weeks reorganizing and sorting
out their Logistics and reinforcing their forces around
pakos and presumably in the toret area um ahead of their spring offensive all
of which is likely to be true and some people are saying that this is all part
that these Ukrainian counter attacks are intended to disrup upt this
process I think it's much more simple than that I think again it's a media
operation we had zelinsky's people arranged for the Daily Telegraph to be
taken to the area um some distance from toret and told there that toret is still
resisting that was Preparatory for some great attack on toret and um we've had
similar things about Cino report about the ukrainians succeeding around C I
think that all of this as I said was again a media operation the ukrainians taking advantage of the ongoing Russian
reorganization to carry out counter attacks that can be represented as
victories but of course the big news as I said is now this disaster in um kusk
in suja now I have to say this whole said reminds me very much of something
that happened in February 2015 the ukrainians at that time the president at
that time being none other than Petro poroshenko also launched an offensive
into U well at that time it was militia controlled territory much as the ukrainians
launched their offensive into Kos region in August
again their forces became trapped or surrounded in a
town called the Bala just as Ukrainian troops look that look as if they're
mostly surrounded in suja this created pressure in the west at the time
to try and push forward negotiations and well something like
that seems to to be happening again this time in February
2015 the encirc of the Ukrainian troops into Balo led to a flight by Angela Merkel
the German Chancellor to Moscow a private meeting between herself and Vladimir
Putin and that in turn set up
the situation for the negotiation that took place shortly after in Minsk out of
which the Minsk agreement came um this time
round um negotiations are already underway the Americans have been
pressing the ukrainians and to a lesser extent
the Russians to sit down and talk just as Merkel
found in February 2015 when she discovered how difficult it was to get
president poroshenko to sign any kind of document or paper that might rescue the Ukrainian
troops into balva and avoid a complete
disaster uh for Ukraine so the Americans are now finding how incredibly difficult
it is to get zalinski to agree to negotiate and to make um
significant um concessions to the Russians in order to bring the war to an
end and just as Merkel began to get frustrated and exasperated with
poroshenko so the Trump Administration which is going through the same cycle
with zalinski is becoming completely frustrated and angry with him as well
and in my program yesterday I discussed how this meeting which is taking place
between the Americans and the ukrainians in Riyad on
Tuesday um it's interesting that the Americans seem to have taken steps to
isolate the ukrainians they're not meeting them in any European country where they might the ukrainians might
have sympathize visors who they could consult and perhaps try to
organize and they have the Americans have also made sure that zalinski
himself who the Americans have now understood is an impossible person to
work with um that zilinski himself is kept being kept far away um by the way
on that there are now claims reports suggestions coming from Ukraine that
that there was never any plan that zalinski would be involved in the discussions in Riyad at all that was
never the intention it was never on the agenda which if true I should say it
would be an extraordinary abdication on his part because after all he is the
president of Ukraine the leader of the country that finds itself in the current
crisis in which it is one would expect him to be leading his
negotiators in any discussions with the Americans which are taking place now
there has been a most interesting report in Bloomberg about um what supposedly the
ukrainians rather what supposedly the Russians said to the Americans in Riyad
and I guess to say straight away that I'm very SK skeptical about this report
in Bloomberg but I will just basically say pass on what it says it says this
Russia is ready to discuss a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine on the condition of
progress towards a final peace settlement sources in Moscow reported
this according to informed individuals now that already Rings alarm
Bells with me which informed individuals are we talking about people in the
Kremlin uh notice that they're not described as officials according to
informed individuals this proposal was conveyed during negotiations in Saudi Arabia last
month between senior Russian and American officials uh this is the first signal of
a positive response from President Putin to the call from his American count part
Donald Trump for a ceasefire for the agreement to to cease hostilities a
clear understanding of the framework principles of a final peace agreement is
necessary said two individuals familiar with the situation two individuals which
individuals as I said they're obviously not officials Russia will insist on
establishing the parameters of a possible peacekeeping mission in including the agreement on participating
countries another added another informed Source also obviously not an official
and um we're then told that the idea of peacekeeping troops from NATO countries
continues to be categorically ruled out now I'm going to say straight away that I don't believe a word of this report
not in the way that it is set out here first of all we know now have a fair
amount of information about what the Americans and the Russians discussed in Riyad and it
looks as if the discussions in RI did not explore um The Contours of a
settlement process between Russia and
Ukraine um instead they focused on such things as reopening the embassies the
embassy the Russian Embassy in Washington and the American Embassy in
Moscow the Russians have already said that there was no detailed discussion
about peace in um Ukraine and that seems
to exclude the Russians coming up with any kind of proposal as apparently worked out as
this one and beyond that I remember that the
point about the Riad talks was that the Russians said that they would wait for the Americans to
appoint a representative to represent their position on negotiations over
Ukraine and that they would wait to see who this person was and when this person
was appointed they would appoint someone at an analogous level to
represent Russia in any talks between the United States and Russia on the
ongoing Ukraine conflict always with the understanding however that the
substantive negotiations would be between Russia and Ukraine so that was
my understanding of the Riad talks so I don't believe that these unknown
mysterious ious informed individuals who could be perhaps
prominent business people just saying U it doesn't seem as if they are actual
Russian officials just saying or there might be people from the media who knows
Moscow like every Big City is full of people who pretend to be well informed
about things who tell everybody that you know they party to parties to secret
information which they can give to um
the West to use media a media agency like
Bloomberg I wonder whether a little bit something like that has been underway but having said that though I
don't believe the story I don't think that this was what the Russians came up
with in ad as I said I get no sense from things that lavro and usikov
the two major Russian negotiators in Riyad I get no sense from them that the
Russians put forward any kind of proposal that as I said as worked out as
this it's not impossible that this article in
Bloomberg does to some extent at least reflect Russian thinking because it is
not so completely at variance with things that the Russians themselves have
said in public now the Russians have repeatedly said they will not agree to a ceasefire a temporary ceasefire any idea
of that kind is completely ruled out but Putin did say when he addressed the
Russian foreign Ministry back in June that the Russians would cease fire in if
the ukrainians began a withdrawal from the four regions from um zapor roia
umon region um donet the ukrainians barely control any
territory any longer in lugansk itself now that the village of
borova has P passed entirely under Russian control so Putin did say
that in June and he did open up the
possibility that in that case there might be a ceasefire and he did also say
back in June as I said of last year that um a peace settlement could then be
found provided it was based on what had previously agreed between Ukraine and
Russia in istan in April 2022 and of course the provisions are
well known they are demilitarization denuclearization
denazification um radical steps which would in effect amount to a fundamental
change of regime in Kiev at least they would now maybe in April
2022 they would not have been that far ranging but that's what they would amount to today now Steve wickoff
um Trump's representative who is not so far as I
know been forly appointed to represent the United States in talks over
Ukraine um but who appears to be assuming that role and may perhaps be
appointed to it eventually anyway witkoff is apparently going to be
leading the discussions with the ukrainians on Tuesday and he's talked
about the United States working towards some kind of framework
agreement um backed by some sort of six months
ceasefire now I wonder whether we aren't seeing
some kind of convergence here of American and Russian positions wit goof
has said in the past that the Istanbul agreements must be the underlying basis
of the negotiations um given that they came so close they
they were they brought Ukraine and Russia so close previously
to an agreement to end the war
and Kellogg who is Trump's other Envoy
on Ukrainian matters though his job appears to be to speak to the Europeans
mostly not even to the ukrainians Much Anymore anyway he's now come out and
said the same thing he said that yes um Istanbul is the basis of the negoti
iations must be the basis or can be the basis of the
negotiations um though as set out it is in some respects unfair and it needs to
be re-calibrated in some ways that Cog didn't really
explain so I I wonder whether
something is being worked on that could be
a little like this um there is a framework agreement
the Americans the Russians agree a framework agreement the
framework agreement is that Ukraine is not going to go join NATO that uh the
Russian language is to be reestablished across Ukraine the Russian Orthodox Church is to be reestablished across the
whole of Ukraine um that these processes of Den nification that the Russians are
talking about should take place I cannot imagine by the way that the Trump Administration would hold out against
that why would they and that there should be a
ceasefire in order to try to bring all of these various Provisions into effect
in other words a ceasefire to make
Istanbul plus happen and that the purpose of the
ceasefire would be firstly to get the ukrainians out of the four
regions and secondly to begin the entire process of iring up the remaining
further details in Istanbul plus and above all to prepare for
negotiations in Ukraine where I get the sense the Americans and the Russians are
looking at different candidates the Americans are thinking of Julia timoshenko the Russians are thinking of
Victor Muk just saying anyway um I wonder
whether there aren't some sort of I suspect very very tentative
discussions along something like those sort of lines now I don't think the
Russians have agreed lead to this and it maybe that they won't I mean they are
now so skeptical that I think that it would probably be more than just a
framework agreement that they would be looking for they would be looking for something more concrete than that they
would be looking I suspect for some American public formal American
commitment to see this thing done the the article
in Bloomberg is floating the possibility
of peacekeeping troops being sent to Ukraine from um China and other neutral
States could it be that the Russians who have up to now
been opposed to any idea of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine um they're now saying or maybe maybe the
idea is and maybe this is going too far to say that the Russians are proposing it maybe it could be that the Russians
are telling the Americans or that there's been some discussion between the Russians and the Americans to the effect
that the Europeans obviously cannot be present in any shape or form in Ukraine
that the United States must cease all intelligence and Military supplies to
Ukraine and that troops from countries friendly
to Russia should be deployed in all of the remaining territories of Ukraine
still outside Russian control beyond the four
regions in places like KF KV adessa all
those sort of places basically to sure that all of the various provisions of
Istanbul plus are indeed properly carried out and that the elections take
place when they do take place on a fair and even footing and that the processes
of deification and demilitarization and that sort of thing
are enacted properly and could it be just saying
that it was these ideas that Sergey Shu came to discuss
with the Chinese leadership with wangyi and S shining when he visited Beijing a
few days ago just say the Russians have also by the way met with uh the So-Cal friends
of Peace group China Brazil and South Africa
in the last couple of days it could be again that if we're looking about deploying forces from these countries
note all of them friends of Russia all of them members of the brick states um
as Russia is itself um well then as I
said one can imagine that such a deployment could take place perhaps as I
said its purpose would be not to police the
ceasefire exactly but to police Ukraine
so as to ensure that all of these Provisions were actually put into effect
at which point we are no longer looking at a ceasefire anymore exactly we're looking
at an Armistice but not an Armistice like the Korean Armistice of
1954 but an Armistice much closer to the Armistice that was negotiated between
Germany and the Western powers in November 1918 the Armistice that brought the
fighting in the first world war to the to an end and which then led directly to
the peace negotiations which took place in Versailles at which the Germans were
basically presented with the final deal which was
of which they angrily and Ever After well at least for the next decades after
referred to as the Versa dictat now it's not
impossible I have received an absolutely brilliant
article by a um commentator that I must confess I don't know um um the title of
this person is ctia the contemplator ctia k a u t l y a with
contemplator it's published on the 4th of March and um it's on stub stack and it's
written endgame in Ukraine the case for direct us Russia
negotiations and um it says direct us negotiations with Russia on ending the
Ukraine war while excluding the zalinski regime and the European countries is the
right path forward based on historical presidence and it's an extremely aidite
and very scholarly article just to say and it's very very interesting because
it goes through similar Wars in which the United States found itself involved
the Korean War of the early 1950s the Vietnam War of the 1960s
and70s and of course the war in Afghanistan and this article makes a
number of points about these wars which is that the United States was deeply
involved obviously in every one of them American troops were actually fighting in each and every one of these wars Now
American troops are not Direct directly fighting or at least not openly and directly fighting in the Ukraine war
which is why some people call it a proxy war but as I explained two days ago that
is not really true because whilst American infantry is not and you know American
armored forces ground troops and Air Force are not directly engaged in the
fighting in all other respects the United States is deeply involved every
bit as deeply involved as it was in Korea of Vietnam and Afghanistan to
repeat they provide the weapons they provide the intelligence they provide the
communications they do most of the command and control and they even carry
out much and perhaps most of the operational planning so they are very
deeply involved much as they were in Korea
Vietnam and in uh Afghanistan and the
cycle that the United States follows in all of these wars is very similar when
you actually compare it so in every one of these wars the United States goes in it takes extremely Hardline positions
it's very resistant to any suggestion of negotiations um it talks about the other
side in the most ferocious language it tries to impose tremendous pressure
against them even mantras like the one
the Biden Administration used to adopt you know uh no talks about Ukraine
without Ukraine um you see precedents for all of that in all of these earlier
conflicts and then gradually gradually the American stance changes when as the war starts to go
wrong now in the course in the in the Korean War U this writer cilia the
contemplator talks about the war having reached the
stalemate that was essentially true but I would say that close students of
the Korean War in which I have by the way familiarize myself to extensively
over the last couple of months anyway close observers of that war now concede
that after a lot of advances backwards and forwards across the Korean peninsula
in the first years of the war um it had indeed
reached a kind of stalemate position but it was a stalemate which was starting to shift
slowly Edge slowly in favor of the Communists the um
Air Battle the air war was starting to um as the balance
was starting to change um Soviet and East European part Pilots when Advanced
Mig 15 fighter jets were taking on the US Air Force um over the Skies of Korea
and was starting to do so successfully and whilst it was as I said
overall still a stalemate um
well it wasn't a coming defeat but anyway the Americans could
perhaps see that the war was not going well and of the political support for the war in the United States was falling
away and President Eisenhower was elected to end the war and to do so as
quickly as possible very similar to what we see with Donald Trump and the same
thing happened in Vietnam where of course the United States was directly involved and you can again argue that in
Vietnam in the late 1960s there was a stalemate but it was a stalemate which
was deeply unsatisfactory for the United States it was causing major economic
strains in the United States and in the world economy not that different in some
respects from the economic strains we see today and the war was also becoming
deeply unpopular and as was the case with Korea so it was with Vietnam that
important sections of the American elite were beginning to turn against it they
were starting to worry that the United States was getting bogged down in Vietnam that the Soviet Union was
capitalizing on the fact and was making progress in overtaking the United States
in strategic weapons an awful lot of that was going on in the United States in the late 60s
and early 1970s and increasingly it came to be understood that the war had to be
brought to an end and the pattern in Afghanistan is again fairly similar the
United States was involved in that war um the war wasn't going especially well
um the Taliban who appeared to have been completely defeated in 2001 had come
back they were slowly gaining ground and they were making progress and and um
eventually the United States after an exhaustive commitment of perhaps a
trillion dollars in Aid and vast amounts of military supplies and all of that
also began to realize that the war had gone as far as it could and that the time had come for the United States to
exit and in every case in all three of these cases the United States which have
taken an exceptionally Hardline at the beginning
found that the proxy that it was supporting the government of singman re
in South Korea the government of President Tu in South Vietnam and the
Pres government of President Alani in Afghanistan was bitterly opposed to the
negotiations wanted to continue the war continue to make maximalist demands
insisted that the war must go on and did everything they could to sabotage the
negotiations so that in every case in the end the United States where the
imperative to end the war was becoming stronger and stronger had to go back on
its previous commitment that it would not negotiate without its proxy being on
side that you know like today's the Biden Administration mantra no talks
about Ukraine without Ukraine that was sheld the Americans did exactly the same
in south over South over the Korean War the um sou the Vietnamese
War and the war um in Afghanistan too
and they started to negotiate directly with the main
adversary and eventually given the
imperative for the United States to extricate itself from the war even
though the United States initially held out against the
demands that the adversary the Communists in North Korea and the
Communists because of course the Soviet Union China and North Korea were all involved in the discussions the
Communists in North Korea the North Vietnamese in the Vietnam War the Taliban in the conflict in Afghanistan
even though the United States initially appeared to reject their demands and resisted many
of their demands eventually after hard negotiations the
United States found that it had no real choice but to come round and the deal
that was eventually done was very very much on the lines of
what the adversary had initially
proposed now in terms of the Korean War the Armistice that was achieved
essentially was an Armistice based on proposals that the Communist side had
made now it was not from the Communist point of view the ideal outcome to the
war but as I've discussed in my previous program the Communist world the Soviet
Union China North Korea were in a much weaker position geost strategically Visa
the United States than Russia China are
today in 1954 the United States
which had only just launched lost its nuclear Monopoly still had overwhelming
superiority in nuclear weapons over the Soviet Union and China and though the
Soviet Union did have nuclear weapons including including um hydrogen the
hydrogen bomb um the Soviets lacked the ability at that time
to launch nuclear strikes directly upon the territory of the United States the
Soviets only began to acquire that capability in the late 1950s their first strategic bomber with
an InterContinental range the tupf 95 only entered service in
1956 and it was only in the late 1950s that the Soviets finally began to
acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles which of of course changed the
entire um nuclear balance and strategic calculus so the
Communists proposed an Armistice less favorable to
themselves than they might otherwise have done because they were aware of
this in terms of the Vietnam War
Armistice the United States had to make very very heavy concessions to the North
Vietnamese and the fact of those concessions in effect facilitated the
North Vietnamese victory in 1975 and the same ultimately is true
about the concessions the United States found itself forced to make to the Taliban over the negotiations that
allowed the United States to extricate itself from Afghan anistan so given that
this is the president nothing that we're seeing now really ought to surprise
us just as previously we got a new President
Eisenhower Nixon determined to end Wars Trump in the case of the Afghan war all
determined to end Wars which were not working out for the United States
presidents who were prepared to break with the previous policy so we are
getting exactly the same today the policy the previous policy has failed
the war has been a failure it has um depleted us arsenals it's created
stresses in the US economy and in the world economy the Western economy it has
created a crisis in international relations which has with Wen the overall
position of the United States and it's enabled American adversaries to
capitalize on America's problems we see exactly the same pattern this time that
pushes the Americans towards wanting peace they want that peace as quickly as
possible and that inevitably leads them to make the concessions they need to
make in order to bring bring that peace about and well that means logically that
when the peace is done probably quite soon actually it will basically be
negotiated or agreed by the Americans and the Russians speaking directly to
each other the ukrainians May perhaps sit down and be the people who
sign the relevant pieces of paper but the Americans and the Russians will have agreed the
peace with each other and it will be a peace on Russian terms and maybe as I
said it will incorporate some of these ideas in the Bloomberg article flooding
Ukraine with troops from countries F friendly to to Russia getting the ukrainians out of the four regions doing
all of those sort of things arranging negotiations in Kev which will of course
leverage zalinski himself out of power and already there are growing
rumors that some kind of media campaign against zalinski is in
preparation that all kinds of Revelations are going to start to appear about the various um assets and things
like that that he and his arm to Raj have saled away these stories may be
true they probably are true actually in fact I'm sure they are or they may be exaggerated but of course the point is
that the purpose is not to expose so much his corruption and that of the
Entourage it is to drive zalinski out to extricate him to decant him if you will
from Kiev so all of that happening
with elections which bring to power
a new government in Kiev either led by timoshenko which is what the Americans
want or led by U Ben vuk which is what the Russians prefer but one a government
that will sign a long-term peace agreement with
Russia on Russian terms and which will close the
chapter on the maidan episode entirely anyway
I could see how we could be heading in that direction and then a lot of the
events of the last couple of hours begin to make sense so we had after the big
missile strike president Trump going on through social saying that Russia is
pounding Ukraine which it is and again appearing to threaten the Russians with
sanctions and banking sanctions and tariffs and all of that kind of thing but then a few hours later Trump
undercut all of that by saying that he understood completely why the Russians were pounding Ukraine in the way that
they were and that in fact the Americans have found the Russians much more easy
to work with on the Ukraine issue than they have found the ukrainians
themselves and that is obviously true and again it's fully consistent
with what we've seen happen in the previous Wars the proxies dig in and try
to sabotage the course to peace um the
comments the Americans have made the Eisenhower people made about Sigman re
in the early 50s privately at least with each other uh the comments they made
Nixon and his people made about uh president T in the
70s are barely different from those that the
Trump people are making about zalinski they're the Trump people being
much more straightforward on doing it in public whilst um Eisenhower and Nixon uh
kept their comments limited their comments in Pro
to things they were saying in private anyway
um one can see the same patterns the prox is making trouble zalinsky making
trouble the Americans determined to achieve
peace talking to the Russians and for all I know and this is where the
Bloomberg article becomes interesting these informed sources in Moscow who are
giving out all of this information are not Russians at all they're not it
identified as Russians the Bloomberg article doesn't say that they're Russians they said they're simply people
who are informed about this matter they could be
diplomats in Moscow either from the United States itself which I would have thought
unlikely or from countries that are friendly to the United States and who
are being briefed by the Americans about some of these ideas which perhaps the
Americans are floating past the Russians anyway it's all very interesting and
very complicated but that then brings me back to this meeting on Tuesday because without zelinsky and without the
Europeans hanging around to me this meeting looks like an another American
Shakedown the Americans are bringing the ukrainians to aiad and they they're
going to read them the riot act what we call in England the riot act in other
words they're going to tell the ukrainians look the United States wants peace it's not going to take no for an
answer we've shown to you the power that we have
we're able to cut off your intelligence we're able to stop your armed supplies
without us you are nowhere and yes you might Scuttle off and talk to your
European friends but where is that getting you as Trump pointed out the
Europeans talk a big game about sending peacekeepers to Ukraine but they still
come out and admit that they need the Americans to provide the back stop in order to pull that one off and the
Europeans are talking now about turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine and all
of that disastrous comments by Ursula F theion by the way but look at it
ultimately in the end it all amounts to nothing they've actually come up with
nothing substantive that they can give to Ukraine in contrast to what the
Americans are already giving the German defense Ministry has effectively admitting that
it's out of weapons these fantastic Plans by the European commission to
spend 800 billion euros on rearmament not money by the way the European Union
has it's money that the Europeans are supposed to cobble up from their own um
um resources um anyway this this plan
um um Fredick mz's plan for Germany to
press forward with unlimited rearmament if it's ever going to work it's going to
take decades to translate into action there's an enormous lordy article about
it in the financial times but even there
there are admissions squirel in from an officer of the bundes affair saying that this isn't going to change anything not
for a long long time because the problems are so deep and so structural
and well the article like every single European commentary about this
project fails to look at the industrial the industrial and technological side of
the picture as well just say but anyway whatever even if these European plans
come true the European themselves are talking about a 4 to
5e time scale before they can help Ukraine and by the way to to say this
clearly that could only take the form of providing more weapons it would take
many many more decades before the uni the Europeans either individually or
collectively could match us intelligence gathering capabilities if they are ever
going to be a able to do that which I strongly doubt and well Ukraine doesn't
have four or five years or 10 years or 20 years or however long it will take
before the Europeans perhaps can get their act together so the Americans are
going to tell the ukrainians look it's ultimately in the end up to you Trump
has said this again by the way um either you work with us to achieve peace to
bring this war to an end even if that accept means basically accepting Russian
terms or you are on your own your European friends cannot help you if you
insist on pressing on and fighting the war then ultimately um you will be left
without our help and you will go down to a total
defeat that's what the Americans are going to say and as I said I suspect that they will be doing what the
Americans always do they will probably maybe not at the meeting in Riad but through other sources through more
informal sources they will be engaging as I said in even stronger warnings warnings
about revealing some of the dark secrets that many members of the Ukrainian Elite
um all have now what will come out if Riad remains to be seen I think the
Russians will play a very cool game if the Americans come and simply support a
ceasefire without any kind of conditions the Russians will say politely no and
they'll remind the Americans that they've been saying no consistently and
that they absolutely oppos deployment of European forces in Ukraine
um um lavro by the way has talked about
this he gave an interview um just the other day it was a press conference in fact in which he was asked the question
Europe is discussing the idea of deploying peacekeepers to ukra to to Ukraine does Moscow still oppose this or
there is room for compromise and lavro said we see no room
for compro compromise this discussion has been conducted with frankly hostile
intentions they do not conceal their underlying objectives if you are if you deploy
troops to a territory you're unlikely to later negotiate terms as you will have
already established facts on the ground and in fact it's a very interesting
press conference that lavro gave and it's combined with a ferocious
statement published by the foreign Ministry the Russian foreign Ministry about macron's comments um
straightforwardly calling macron a liar for saying that it was Russia that um
obstructed implementation of the Minsk agreement the Russians outline the
extent to which macron himself was involved in the discussions to implement
the Minsk agreement and definitely knows otherwise it's a state by the way and
comments from the Russians which tells me indicates to me
that as far as the Russians are concerned macron is now such damaged
goods that he's no longer welcome in Moscow just saying but anyway
um it may be that the Americans will come up with some of these ideas again the Russians will say a polite no they
will continue with a special military operation if the Americans switch on the intelligence again and start resupplying
weapons well it will slow things down a little but the Russians will continue to
hammer away at Ukraine as they have been doing very successfully over the last
few years and anyway it is not going to save those Ukrainian troops who are now
surrounded in kque region so the Russians would simply say to the
Americans okay we're still here we're ready to talk when you're ready to talk
we'll wait for you to eventually come round to our point of view and the
Russians know that the Americans will they know that they will because the Americans ultimately have no alternative
they've signaled to the Russians they want the war to end there are compelling reasons why they would want the war to
end and historical precedent shows that the United States does cling on and
continue a war that has become a lost course so we'll see what comes out of
Riyad perhaps as I said the ukrainians will start to shift ground though given
how stubborn they are I wouldn't count on it just saying in the
meantime the hysteria the tantrum in Europe continues I read a journalist in the
guardian poly toin B who straightforwardly and without any explanation or comment referred to Vlad
to Donald Trump as a Russian asset a hooligan Russian asset by the way um an
observation that could never have passed Once Upon a Time it through the editors
of the Guardian I read um that there was a bizarre article a week ago in the
financial times about a complex plot between the Americans and the Russians to restart nordstream 2 and get
nordstream back on in online with the Americans and the Russians working
together um lots of people took that article as true by the way ignoring the
fact that the German businessman at the center of the whole um article the
person who was supposed to be um involved in all of those uh discussions
Matias vanig categorically denied the whole article as did um uh pesov Putin
spokesman when he was asked about it but anyway the financial times ignored their
denial so did everyone else many people as I said assume this article must be
true it's even led to extraordinary comments floating around in
Germany saying that the German government is looking to find ways to prevent nordstream 2 remember being
reactivated which um just goes to show how complete the flight from reality The
Descent into Insanity has gone um there's apparently an article I mean I
read reports about this though I haven't found I actually haven't found it also
in the financial times which says that um the financial times one of their
journalists Mr Cooper has been told by an East European politician that the
East European states are now so worried about the situation that they're planning a preemptive military strike
against Russia to achieve what exactly their own destruction World War
III presumably an American Russian war at precisely the time when and the
Americans are showing no interest in it but anyway um in Britain today there
is the media is dominated with the story about a number of bulgarians who have
been arrested charged and convicted of spying for Russia I'm not going to get
into the details of the story or whether it is true or not because I truly don't
know but um it is now I think a conf confirmed fact that Britain was
recruiting assets intelligence assets inside Russia during the 1990s when
relations between Russia and Britain were good so is it a surprise that the
Russians are trying to recruit or to uh create intelligence
Assets in Britain at a time when relations between Russia and Britain are
very bad anyway we're getting all this all of this hysteria all of this tant
all of these tantrums but the realities remain the same the Russians are
continuing to win the war they have apparently trapped a significant number
of Ukrainian troops in suja and that battle looks like it's going to end in
disaster for Ukraine they're hammering away at Ukraine again the Americans and
the Russians continue their dialogue which Trump says is better than the one
that America has with Ukraine and the Americans are going to give the
ukrainians the Shakedown in Riyad these are the real events that are actually
taking place all of the theater of the Absurd that is playing out in Europe all
it is doing is exposing the complete weakness frivolity
incompetence insanity ity in some cases to which the European political class
has descended as it begins to grasp the reality of its own powerlessness well
that's it that's my program for today tomorrow I propos to say a little more
about the Russian reaction to macron's speech I think the Russian reaction is
in some ways more consequential and interesting than macron's speech it's self and of
course the Descent in Syria has accelerated with heavy fighting now in
Latakia which I will also probably touch on in my next program that's me for
today more for me soon um let me remind you once again you can find our programs
