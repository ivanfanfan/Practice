hi everyone Judge Andrew Npalitano here
for Judging Freedom today is Tuesday uh
April 8th 2025 professor Jeffrey Sax
joins us now professor Saxs a pleasure
as always thank you great to be with you
um I want to ask you about
um what military gain what political
gain what geopolitical gain there is
with the United States bombing a
helpless country like Yemen and then
this morning I saw uh a video that the
president of the United States himself
posted on his own uh website of about 30
or 40 men in a circle or an oval uh
about to break we we can't show you what
happens because the of the sensors about
to break their Ramadan fast when one of
Pete Hegath's bombs uh obliterated uh
all of them in the president's posting
the full video is there we're obviously
not going to uh show it what is gained
by this the the posting the boasting and
the
killing
obviously we gain nothing except to
prolong America's expensive uh cruel
illegal perpetual war in the Middle East
at Israel's behalf this is a war that
stretches across North Africa Libya East
Africa Sudan
Somalia into the Eastern
Mediterranean Gaza the West Bank Lebanon
Syria Yemen and of course with the
intention of Netanyahu who was in
Washington this week uh to extend it to
Iran this is a a regional war that has
raged for more than 20 years uh it's a
war that comes because there is
uh no peace due to Israel's policy of
domination over the Palestinian people
which generates support for the
Palestinians including military support
around the region netanyahu's doctrine
as we've discussed is never to negotiate
never to compromise but rather to crush
not only the Palestinians but the
Libyans uh Somalians Sudin Lebanese
Iraqis Syrians and Yemenites who would
support the Palestinian cause uh you
name them as terrorists you name them
for whatever you want but the terror and
in fact the genocide now is being
committed by Israel in uh Gaza and in
Palestine not because there is an
implacable opposition but because Israel
is implacable about dominating what they
call greater Israel this is a mix of
theological and
secular desires of a radical uh
extremist uh government which Netanyahu
leads and uh has been his vision for 30
years we are party to that uh Trump
again gave a green light in the visit to
Netanyahu a man that is under an arrest
warrant by the International Criminal
Court
for war crimes and crimes against
humanity we have seen in recent days the
brutal slaughter of aid workers
deliberately targeted by the
Israelis uh nothing stops it so when you
ask what what's the gain well you can
say "But the Houthis are attacking us
because they're defending the
Palestinian cause." Oh the Hezbollah
they're attacking because they're
defending the Palestinian cause hamas
they're attacking because they're
defending the Palestinian cause and the
point is that Israel says there is no
Palestinian cause we crush them we kill
them we destroy them we ethnically
cleanse them we colonize the West Bank
with hundreds of thousands of settlers
of course there will be no peace that
way but is that really America's best
interest perpetual war uh to bankrupt
our country to isolate our country
internationally to absolutely break
relations across the world because
people can see this for what it is
complicity uh in an ongoing uh
suppression and commission of war crimes
so it's very very sad because war cannot
solve political issues it can kill a lot
of people but it can't solve basic
political issues our uh friend and
colleague uh Colonel Douglas McGregor uh
has offered here and
elsewhere that the demands that
President Trump has imposed on Iran a
dismantling of uh nuclear facilities
which his own CIA and DIA and other
intelligence communities tell him do not
exist a dismantling of ballistic
missiles and other offensive weaponry a
would essentially reduce Iran
uh to uh a non-s sovereign country
something sort of like Syria and B are
non-starters so I wonder if these
demands in your view Professor Saxs that
the president has made uh is just an
excuse to engage in the war that
Netanyahu ardently
wants we should understand that uh part
of US arrogance over the last 30 years
is you don't negotiate with the other
side you you bomb it you threaten it uh
you believe that American dominance
always prevails and in the case of Iran
there was a negotiated
agreement to uh end uh Iran's nuclear
program at whatever state it is and in
return to end sanctions that was the
joint comprehensive plan of action or
JCPOA negotiated in 2016 by several
countries including the United States
when Donald Trump came into office in
2017 he immediately repudiated the JCPOA
at Israel's urging by the way Israel
wasn't interested in the
denuclearization of the JCPOA israel was
interested in Iran being the seventh war
that was on the list that we've
discussed many times israel wants the
United States to bomb and ostensibly
destroy Iran and so there was an
agreement we were there this is uh like
what happened in North Korea by the way
same thing in the late
1990s president Clinton negotiated with
North Korea a program for
denuclearization the United States did
not carry out its
obligations north Korea violated terms
of the agreement as well in those
circumstances you double down and get
back to the agreement that was signed
instead George Bush Jr came in appointed
John Bolton one of our most uh
destructive diplomats of modern history
bolton said "Take a hardline uh threaten
and cajol the North Koreans." And yes
what do we have in the end a nuclear
North Korea with the ever growing uh
nuclear arsenals and delivery
capabilities because we rejected the
negotiated path so now same thing maybe
Trump says yes we'll negotiate but we'll
destroy them if they don't agree on our
terms we've heard that before this is
the American approach that fails again
and again and again uh somehow American
leaders believe that the key is to show
utter disrespect and disdain for the
other side and that that somehow brings
about the desired outcome this is the
opposite of the truth it's the opposite
of how we should behave in our daily
lives visa v other people that we want
to have a a normal ongoing relationship
with it's the opposite of how you should
behave with an irassable neighbor next
door uh it is the opposite of a way to
reaching a real agreement we will
threaten trump will cajul he'll say
we'll destroy you who knows but very
likely negotiations will collapse in
distrust and then God knows what will
happen will it be war will it be a
nuclear Iran we don't know but to get to
an agreement one actually has to
approach matters through uh building a
sense of confidence on both sides that
one could actually find the mutual
benefit of ending a a nuclear program or
definitively ending it if it is
essentially ended and on the other side
ending the threats and the sanctions and
the risks of attacking that country
under uh the control of
a really disgusting Israel lobby which
pushes relentlessly for America to be at
war that you have to actually solve by
talking with the other side not merely
threatening the other side but America
and I don't mean American people of
course i mean the arrogant people in
Washington who believe that only threats
and bombs are the solution have led us
for 30 years of non-stop war since the
early 1990s it's unbelievable but that's
still where we are until today here's uh
the president yesterday after just
having had lunch with Prime Minister
Netanyahu now he's seated next to uh the
prime minister but you can't see him in
this clip but there's one or two lines
in here that probably made Netanyahu's
eyebrows raise even though the the
target of what Trump is saying is Iran
uh this is the Oval Office yesterday
chris cut number four is the United
States under your leadership ready to
take military action to destroy the
Iranian nuclear program program and
remove this
threat i think if the talks aren't
successful with
Iran I think Iran is going to be in
great danger and I hate to say it great
danger because they can't have a nuclear
weapon so is that you know it's not a
complicated uh formula iran cannot have
a nuclear weapon that's all there is
can't have ready right now we have
countries that have nuclear power that
shouldn't have it but uh I'm sure we'll
be able to negotiate out of that too as
part of this later on down the line but
Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and if
the talks are
successful I actually think it'll be a
very bad day for Iran
we get to Iran he's seated three feet
away from someone who runs a government
that
illegally possesses nuclear weapons
that's another long story in its own
right how the United States uh uh tried
to uh prevent Israel from getting
nuclear weapons in the late 50s
President Eisenhower President Kennedy
and the machinations that Israel took
with many charges being made and so
forth that I won't go into but in any
event uh yes Israel is a nuclear power
that is obviously not shy at deploying
I'll say the US military at its side
because it pulls the US into war after
war after war on its unjust behalf uh
and it wants to do the same with Iran
president Trump is correct it's not not
that complicated in fact he walked into
office the first time on January 20th uh
2017 with such an agreement already in
hand perhaps he couldn't stand that it
was an Obama negotiated agreement
perhaps he just fell under the Israel
lobby perhaps he just took the hardline
position which he often takes which is
any agreement must be bad if the other
side agreed uh we have to add more
pressure until an agreement collapses so
that we can add even more pressure to
get whatever we want or at least as he
believes so uh the agreement was already
there it's true he's right an agreement
could be reached uh threatening to
destroy Iran uh is not a great way to
get that agreement I have to say but uh
an agreement could be reached because
it's a proof of concept we already had
that agreement do do we know if American
intel
uh views Iran as a threat to Israel we
know American intel views Iran as no
threat whatsoever to the United States
isn't it more likely that Israel is a
threat to Iran than that Iran is a
threat to Israel
i don't know the American Intel and
anything called American Intel i put
intel in quotation marks of course of
course it's it's what the intelligence
agency and intelligence in that phrase
is a term of art it's not a an adjective
not an intelligence how did they co-opt
that word Jeff well it it's that's
that's another very good question but
the fact of the matter is uh it's not a
matter is it a threat or isn't a a
threat it's what we make of another
country if we threaten other countries
with bombing if we violate agreements if
we negotiate agreements and then we stop
them by the way it is worth recalling
for I I hope some listeners who if if
they haven't read about it will go back
to read it the US ended Iran's democracy
in
1953 uh in a joint MI6 CIA coup against
Prime Minister Mosedc
mosedc was an elected
popular very intelligent prime minister
of Iran who had the tmerity to believe
that the oil under the ground belonged
to them not to the British and the
Americans the nerve of it all uh so they
overthrew him in 1953 and installed a
police state until 1979
then we were very upset when the
Iranians were upset with us for those
decades of a police state but have no
fear when their revolution came in 1979
uh and we had the hostage taking and
then the hostages released at the time
of President Reagan coming to office
what did the United States do the United
States armed Iraq saddam Hussein
remember our good friend and ally the
one that we overthrew later on armed
Saddam Hussein to go kill hundreds of
thousands of
Iranians and with absolute devastation
of civilian populations we did that we
armed and equipped and financed Iraq to
devastate Iran we've been there before
overthrows coups police state and we say
"Look at how terrible what an enemy they
are what a danger they are." There's a
history to everything and it's often
worth recalling the history if we sat
down now and discussed if we had just
abided by an agreement negotiated in
2016 if we
took as we should have the repeated I
would say almost incessant peace feelers
by the Iranians during the brain deadad
Biden
administration which neglected or threw
out every time Iran tried to return to
the negotiating
table we may have been somewhere
different from where we are right now we
just can't get it through our fixed
skulls in Washington that threats and
war and bombing and overthrows are not
the right way to make peace
let me take you back to the conversation
we had uh last
Thursday which was uh received uh by an
enormous uh audience uh in which uh you
and I were harshly critical you from an
economic point of view me from the legal
and constitutional point of view
although you made these arguments
articulately
uh of the president's tariffs what
effect do these tariffs as unlawful
unconstitutional and misguided
economically as they are what effect do
they have on the geopolitics that we
have been discussing
well first of all people are not amused
all over the world that 10 trillion
dollars of uh market capitalization has
been wiped out in three days they're not
amused that we're spiraling into a new
economic downturn that there's more
economic unpredictability than there has
been in decades uh we have uh China
saying uh no uh we're not going to be
blackmailed by you Mr trump uh and then
uh President Trump saying "Okay I add
another
50% to uh 50 percentage points to the
tariff rates to put them over 100%." And
apparently just before we're speaking
now if I caught a headline properly uh
the US is saying it's going to move
forward on that i don't know whether
that's actually the fact because I
haven't seen a detailed report but um
within 3 days uh the the uh world system
was overturned by an executive order
that starts with the powers invested in
me as president of the United States i
declare an emergency this is not how the
United
States operates as a democracy this is a
a degradation and derriagation of
democracy it's a it's a disgrace that
our country operates this way but it's
operating this way uh and affecting the
entire world now we're seeing uh all
over the world countries scrambling to
understand some yes they're coming in
bended knee what do we have to do to uh
make you happy uh Mr president uh so
some are doing that that no doubt
delights uh the white house uh some are
taking the view that this is absolutely
unacceptable for one person by a self
declaration to break a system built over
many decades and most countries are
asking my god who are our trade partners
what are we going to do next week uh
what are we going to do when the tariffs
start hitting and so I believe that many
many uh countries are coming to the view
quickly we need to cooperate among
ourselves because the United States is
breaking apart uh things that our people
depend on for their livelihoods there
was a call between the president of the
European
Commission Ursula Vanderland and the
prime minister of uh China where the two
sides said we had better negotiate
stability right now so that we don't
amplify the uh devastating effects that
Trump's decisions are having on the
world economy so China and the European
Union are I hope uh sitting down in a
mature way to say let's not amplify this
uh I mentioned last time we talked that
India and China are taking steps to make
sure that the relationship is calm and
balanced uh China Korea and Japan are
taking such steps asean uh the 10
countries of Southeast Asia have been
meeting to discuss how ASEAN should
coalesce more closely together among
themselves which is 700 million people
and I know
and believe that ASEAN recognizes that
it must integrate even more with China
uh as a result of the instability coming
from across the Atlantic Ocean so Trump
has
uh single-handedly by a a decree not
debated deliberated in Congress not
voted on the basis of law uh no uh
uh backing uh in the American business
community uh no backing by the American
public
i certainly thrown the entire world
into a crisis and a crisis that I think
will cause countries to coalesce in a
kind of defensive mode with each other
uh facing the United States as a dire
economic threat to them
professor Saxs thank you very much we've
been all over the globe and I deeply
appreciate your comments i know it's the
middle of the night where you are you're
