all right Alexander let's talk about the recent statements from Russian President
Vladimir Putin as uh he was at the Arctic Summit and then he went to uh to
inspect a nuclear submarine a submarine with hypersonic uh missiles by the way
and he made some very interesting statements perhaps the most interesting
statements to date from the uh Russian president he talked uh about the government in
Kiev the illegitimate government of of Kiev he talked about some sort of uh un
uh governance of Ukraine because the the current government is illegitimate so uh
Putin mentioned that perhaps the UN can can step in as a solution to govern
Ukraine until elections take place and then he said that the Russian military
is uh in a position to finish off the Ukraine military he did acknowledge that
the operation has been going uh slowly or slower than people had expected but
uh he does appear confident that the Russian military is now moving towards uh a victory a decisive Victory and he
did use the words finish off that is uh that is the uh the quote from the
Russian president president and it uh it seemed to me as if this was not only um
a glimpse into into perhaps how Putin is seeing the the final outcome in Ukraine
but it also could serve as as a warning a final warning to uh to Ukraine perhaps
to the Trump Administration to to get a deal in place along the uh June 2024
Istanbul plus uh line or else Russia's going to to advance towards a military
solution a military Victory and then things will change and that's where the
the UN comes in anyway your your thoughts on uh the statements from the Russian president uh absolutely and I'm
going to point out something else he said virtually nothing about the ongoing diplomacy the
negotiations with the United States I I I don't think he believes they're going
to go anywhere where uh that was my strong sense of this and um one can see
why because we've had negotiations about two ceasefires the 30-day ceasefire on
Energy Systems the Russians say the ukrainians are not complying with them
with it and the Black Sea initiative looks like it's dead even before it got
off the ground because the European Union is now adamantly refusing to lift
any of the sanctions that the Russians say must be lifted in order to bring the
Black Sea initiative back into place so I I don't think he at the moment
seriously believes that this negotiation process is going to go very far and he
also made further comments saying that the Russians had been tricked multiple
times in the past and that they were not to be tricked again now he focused on
the Europeans because he didn't want to criticize the Americans but he said all of that as
well Boris Johnson he was he focused on focused on Boris John but also but he
also mentioned malel orand he brought up the issue of the Minsk agreement I don't
think he believes that there can ever be a diplomatic settlement to the conflict
so I I think think he's now if you like just lifted
slightly um the curtain on how he expects this war to end he expects it to
end in a military Victory um he believes the Russian army will defeat Ukraine I
think he believes that it will do it quite soon he talked about how the Russians hold the initiative right
across the contact line he spoke about how most of the four regions in is
already controlled by Russia he clearly wants regime change in Kiev so I think
what he wants is a complete military defeat of Ukraine at some point maybe
this year there's talk that the Russians are preparing a big offensive for the
spring and summer which I think is quite plausibly true um after that defeat
which realistically will have to take in the Black Sea I mean the Black Sea Coast
because I I can't imagine what Putin is talking about next
can happen unless you know Ukraine loses its access to the Sea so that Putin is
in a position to dominate the situation and also I think he expects the Russian army to take control of sui and KH
regions as well anyway at that point he wants um un trust trusteeship over for
Ukraine what's left of Ukraine pending new elections um this has happened
before by the way uh there's been uh I don't know specifically with the UN but
there have been periods of time when the UN has uh when you know before the
League of Nations and then the UN has exercised some kind of trusteeship but
that's basically to my mind what where he's where he's thinking so Russia
Russian army advances defeats the Ukrainian Army the
Russian army has been reinforcing steadily throughout the winter um the
ukrainians are defeated militarily maybe um Kiev itself is either you know put
under enormous pressure or whatever zalinski is forced to step down the
country is put under un trusteeship and then there are elections and he also made it again
clear by the way that he doesn't consider zilinski legitimate and doesn't
believe that zeleny can sign any peace to any peace agreement it's not only
that uh zolin is not legitimate because zalinski is illegitimate everyone under
him correct is illegitimate the whole apparatus is is uh is illegitimate what
do they call that in legal terms the the uh the the the fruit on the tree or the or the
the the the fruit of the poisoned tree right something like that is that's how
I'm picturing it in my head but basically you have an illegitimate guy yes and everything that that he does
everything that he signs everyone that he's appointed yes it's just all it's
all illegitimate so you have to just replace the the entire apparatus and um
and there is precedent I'm just looking at it right now Alexander um East teamour Papo Nini as well well as uh
parts of former Yugoslavia this this un um governance or temporary un
Administration has been employed why the UN do you trust the UN
why the UN especially when the UN has also uh uh crossed um double crossed
Russia during the grain deal I remember incudes was working with the Biden Administration against Russia and that's
the UN the Secretary General and lvov called out the UN for what they did uh during that uh 20
2022 2022 2023 grain deal that's right so why trust the the UN how can you
trust the security Council yes Russia and China are on the security Council but you know you have the United States
on the security Council you have the UK uh there why the UN why go through the
UN well because it because it is the one international body um which the Russians
have some say over I mean they are a permanent member of the security Council
um so anything that goes through the security Council must be agreed by them
they have power of vet over it and beyond that um they have friends um in
the UN which they don't basically in any other major International institution um
by the way speaking of friends the Chinese foreign minister Wang Y is
coming to Moscow and they're going to talk about all of this uhu who was
Putin's uh who Putin's National Security advisor has also recently been speaking
to the Chinese there's actually been a lot of intense diplomatic interaction
with China between China and Russia principally I'm sure about
Ukraine because we're all focused on what the Trump Administration has been doing all of that's been going on under
the radar but I think that this is you know this is probably the Chinese and the Russians
coordinating positions um about um how to take the question of Ukraine forward
and I would not be surprised if the Chinese have quietly told the Russians
look we're not saying anything publicly but you know we we are aware of all these plans that you have and um if you
want us to help you when the moment to put it to the UN comes we will be there
with you well he did mention uh in his uh statements that uh he he would look at
some sort of of a monitoring uh group or some sort of a coalition yeah to help
implement this idea or at least take this forward in Ukraine but it would not consist of uh of um France and the UK it
would not a maon and stomber uh initiative though he did say that he's
not closing the door on the European Union even though the EU and Europe remains hostile to to Russia Putin being
the the Statesman and the Diplomat that he is he he did he didn't shut the door on working with Europe in the future
obviously he didn't shut the door on the us but he did say that Russia is ready to work with Partners including the us
but also China India Brazil South Africa bricks countries he even said North
Korea which I find interesting because you have stammer and makaron and they're having this uh this submit in Paris
where they're talking about the the Coalition of the of the Willing which has now been rebranded to the
reassurance force and uh and they're talking about the UK and France entering Ukraine if if there is some sort of a
ceasefire deal and here you have Putin coming along inspecting a a nuclear sub
with hypersonic missiles of which Europe does not have of which the United States does not have and uh he's talking about
perhaps uh some sort of of a coalition but this Coalition would consist of
bricks and uh possibly even North Korea and even the United States there's no
Europe uh in this Coalition he doesn't shut the door to Europe no but in this Coalition that Putin uh envisages
there's no there's no Europe uh European uh role to be played absolutely he I mean to be frank yes he said you know
the door is always open to Europe we can speak with them in the future but I mean
basically he doesn't trust them and that came over very clearly in what he said I
don't think he expects the Europeans to play much or indeed any role um but he
did talk quite a lot about the bricks and um he brought in the bricks and
clearly they are now the major um you know the PE the people he is talking
about most I I'm pretty sure that he's already talked about some of these ideas
at least with the Chinese maybe not so far with the Indians and the Brazilians
because I mean perhaps he worries sorry he's going to India he's going to India
exactly he's going to India very soon but he's probably worried especially he talks to the Brazilians that a lot of
that will then lead back to Washington so at the moment I suspect he's careful about what he says but he is indeed
going to India very soon and he will be meeting Modi and IP bet the Indians will
be open to this too um I I I think that there is a basic misunderstanding here I
think last year India and Brazil were trying very
hard to get um a ceasefire the Russians if you remember basically talk them out
of Demands for a ceasefire I think we've moved on quite a long way from that
point now and I think the Indians and the Brazilians have been brought by the russan on side I think people who expect
India and Brazil and China to weigh in
on um Americas and Ukraine's behalf to get the Russians to accept a ceasefire
on basically American terms I'm mistaken now I think we've that was a possibility
a year ago I don't think it's a possibility anymore so what does uh the Trump
Administration do how do they react to these uh statements from Putin uh pesov
said in a statement that Russia will comply with the ceasefire agreements yes the energy infrastructure ceasefire uh
and the black C ceasefire though that one um seems like it's not even going to get up off the ground unless the
Europeans decide to uh to start lifting some of the sanctions and uh reinstate
the the Russian AG cultural bank and Russian institutions uh into uh into various um
payment systems and Swift and stuff like that and the Europeans in their conference that they had in Paris they
said no way they said no way are we going to lift any sanctions against Russia they basically
rejected uh Trump's Black Sea ceasefire uh proposal so what does the the US do
they see that Europe wants to continue the conflict they see that Europe wants to escalate
uh UK and France they have zero chance to accomplish anything in Ukraine
without the US backing Stam Marron all all but admitted as much they talk about
sendly troops but they came out with statements basically saying without the United States we really can't do
anything so we need a us back stop they're also warning the Trump Administration that Putin is trying to
to trick them uh is trying to trick the Trump Administration and for the Trump Administration to side with the
Europeans and to continue the escalation uh the United States cannot escalate with Russia though I don't think the US
has the means uh the desire the means the weapons um I don't think they they
can escalate militarily I don't think they can escalate uh economically either
to be quite honest uh but but perhaps the Trump Administration may look at the statements from Putin and say well uh it
looks like our negotiations are not going to go anywhere so do we do do we
continue to normalize with Russia without some sort of a Ukraine uh deal
do we play along with with the ceasefire maybe just drag this out and pretend
that we're we're achieving various goals when it comes to our uh our ceasefire
objective a 100 days Trump has said he has 100 days to to get the ceasefire do we just kind of play this theater along
with the Russians and eventually there will be a military solution uh that helps us kind of of get rid of project
Ukraine in a way or do they side with the Europeans does the Trump Administration have a change of heart
and say you know what makaron I get along with you I like you that's what Trump could say I don't I
don't particularly like stabber but uh I can get along with you makaron and okay
we'll send uh some money to Ukraine or we'll propose to Congress another bill to send money to Ukraine and we'll try
to keep this war going as long as we can it's a loser it's a loser the American people are going to be upset but um you
know the neocon faction of the Trump White House wins out I mean what's how does how does all of this play out now
perhaps Putin is speaking with with Trump about this stuff maybe the US and Russia are are coordinating in a way or
maybe they were given a heads up about uh this un plan uh what are your
thoughts well that's these are excellent questions because it seems to me that we
now find ourselves in a position where it is the United States that has to make
some very very important decisions over the next few weeks now first of all they
they basically pushed Ukraine um to commit to
an unconditional ceasefire and Ukraine did that after the talks in jeda but
it's a fact people don't seem to notice is that as soon as those talks in jeder
Ended as soon as yamak and the others came back to Kiev as soon as um you know
the talk about the unconditional ceasefire uh um was agreed the ukrainians basically walked it all back
they continued to say that all the territories must be returned to them they continued to insist that NATO
membership um is Ukraine's Sovereign right they really um say one thing to
the Americans and then when the um this discussions with the Americans have
ended they go back to Kiev and they revert to their original positions and I don't think that's ever going to change
and I don't think the ukrainians are ever going to um ever um really honor a
proper ceasefire in the way that I think the Americans would like them to um and
the whole the whole thing about getting EU troops into Ukraine is not to
end the war it is to escalate it zalinski has actually in a sense
given the game away there because he says he he doesn't want peacekeepers he
wants Warriors he wants people who are prepared to come and fight so you know
clearly he envisages the war continuing he just wants to get the Western Powers
directly involved in fighting Russia because as he knows perfectly well by
itself Ukraine can't win now the the Trump Administration has found it's got
this problem with Ukraine the Trump Administration is finding that it's got
problems with the Europeans as well I mean they're persisting with this peacekeeping Force idea the Russians
have repeatedly said that they're opposed to it the Trump Administration if it was really serious
about seeking peace with the Russians would have said straight away this idea
won't fly it not only does not have the backing of the United States the United
States is opposed to it because it stands in the way of negotiations um I've never understood
why Trump has never done that um he seems to think that um he can just park
this issue and that it will never really cause problems
in the negotiations I don't think the Russians think that now he came up with the black idea of Reviving The Black Sea
initiative it's difficult to understand actually why he did that because um as
many people have pointed out as we have pointed out in reality uh if it's all
about commercial shipping in the Black Sea the Russians have never interfered
with commercial shipping in the Black Sea the Ukrainian grain ships are able to come and go from Messa and the
Russians have never attempted at any point in the whole period of the special
military operation to interfere with them now the Europeans are refusing to
lift the sanctions which the Russians say the need to be lifted in order to
make this work what the Europeans are not
acknowledging what the media in Europe is not acknowledging is that the
Europeans apparently agreed to lift all these sanctions back in
2022 which is how we got the Black Sea initiative in the first place the Black
Sea initiative failed because the Europeans didn't do what they promised
then and it doesn't look as if they're prepared to do it now so the Black Sea
initiative is dead in the water so what does the administration do well I think
we have a clue and this is in this revised mineral rights extraction
agreement which we haven't yet seen the papers the document itself but
apparently it has been massively expanded and enormously toughened so it
apparently now says uh that all r all all resources basically all of Ukraine's
resources will now belong to uh this corporate entity that is being set up to
run them and that corporate entity will be controlled by the United States I be
that apparently that is clear now from the agreement there'll be a board of five three will be
Americans so a and they will have veto power over anything that this particular
board decides to do it is indefinite this right to
extract Ukraine's resources is indefinite it is in perpetuity I pointed
we pointed out by the way that the deal that zalinski was supposed to sign um
back in February when he went to the Oval Office that also was a deal in
perpetuity but this time apparently that has been made clear there is no security
guarantee for Ukraine attached to this deal but most important of all
apparently this time it is made absolutely explicit that this mineral rights extraction deal is um intended to
pay the United States back for weapons the cost of the weapons and the money
the United States has already supplied to Ukraine in other words the period up
to the point When Donald Trump became president it's not forward you know for things it's
backwards it's backwards backwards here now that the terms of the deal look so
harsh that I think it could almost be said to be calculated for the ukrainians
to reject it the Americans will then say well Ukraine is not prepared to pay us
back for what we have given the negotiations have become come stuck
they're not moving forward Trump has given it the best he can so when it
becomes clear that this isn't moving forward and zalinsky for the moment says he's not going to Washington he's not
going to go to Washington to sign it well that gives the Americans
perhaps the opening they need to do that which I think they should have done long ago which is walk away and I think that
is where we are I mean bear in mind we've also had two reports now from the
US military from the US intelligence community that said they can't win well
they can't win exactly they said they can't win and the um the the assessment
the the long you know annual intelligence review not only said
they can't win in military terms it also acknowledged
that sanctions further sanctions are not going to change the
situation yeah that's what I said they can't win said they can't win on on military terms and they can't win with
the with the sanctions yes the United States the the statement from Putin is I
go back to it yeah because Putin said we will work with any Partners when he's talking about the the UN and the UN
governance and everything going forward with Ukraine this idea that he has we will work with Partners the US the US
China India Brazil South Africa bricks countries and for example North Korea that's a direct yeah quote yes I mean he
throws the US in there yes with with countries that under Biden the US would never be I mean this is this this is
Biden's axis of Evil as as he defined it right North Korea China India right yeah
I mean it's it's an incredible um quote from from Putin but he puts the US in
there Russia is now uh working with uh with the US and
the United Nations in the UN yes they worked together on I believe a resolution for
Syria and they also worked together on a couple of other resolutions they voted together yes on on a couple of
resolutions something that I I can't remember the last time the uh the US and
Russia voted together in alignment on uh on various resolutions in the security
Council while the UK and France while they did not vote against it they uh they abstained from these resolutions
that were proposed by the US and Russia so perhaps there is some dialogue about
uh about the UN with China Russia and the United States uh taking the lead in
in these types of initiatives uh we do know that the the Trump Administration also wants zilinski gone so they have
that in common Russia wants zinsky gone the United States wants zinsky gone no
one has quite figured out how to do it perhaps this is the the way that uh
that they do it uh what what are your thoughts on on that yeah and there's
also been one other very intriguing piece of news which one doesn't quite know what to make about it but it is
interesting and that is that Elise stefanic who was Trump's uh proposed
Ambassador for the UN that nomination has now been pulled she's no longer been
um proposed for the UN ambassadorship she's going to remain in the House of
Representatives now the reason that's been given is that um she is um needed
in the House of Representatives because the Republican minority majority there
is so narrow and you know they can't risk um you you know um out of term
elections all of that the problem with that is that stefanik's seat apparently
is a solidly republican so more more
likely than not especially with the Democrats very unpopular at the moment um whoever was the Republican candidate
would win so I wonder whether the reason that they've pulled stefanik's
nomination is because she is a person who takes very hard line I would say neon
views on foreign policy and it there's now a sense that maybe she's not the
best person to work with the Russians going forward this is a pure guess I
mean I don't know but I wonder whether this is um this is
uh another Telltale sign of the things to come we'll just have to see we'll
have to wait and see who is nominated in in her place but um it's not impossible
that the United States might go along with the UN trusteeship plan I I I don't
see why they wouldn't um it would be a way of getting the United States
basically to give its support to this um the Russians need the Americans on side
if there is going to be a un trusteeship plan because obviously the United States
has veto power in the security Council just as Russia does and the question
then is um will the United States exert its influence its enormous potential
influence over the Europeans Britain and France to see that this thing is piloted
through I think they will by the way I think that this is perhaps where we are
going um and I think quite plausibly the Americans could be involved and maybe
Putin will tell Trump look when this is over when we got all this sorted out we
can dust out your mineral rights extraction deal we can come up with something along the lines of that and
you can go in and you can extract these minerals to your heart's content and to the extent that there are any and we're
prepared to play more with you on this um and you know some of the other plans
you know Reviving nordstream giving the Americans a cut in it that kind of thing that might also come
to I mean it is not impossible there's a lot of business there's a lot of business the Russians the Russians will
no doubt also go on telling the Americans look we have a absolutely critical
relationship it is searly important for the future of our two countries and for
the stability of the world we can't afford not to talk to each other because
the Europeans don't want us to isn't a reason for not doing so so I I I think
that we will probably continue to see uh negotiation you know contacts between
the United States and Russia continue and it could be that as I said if and
when well I I would say when the Russians achieve this military victory that Putin is now expecting um that it
could all crystallize and we could finally get uh um you know movement
together the Americans and the Russians sort things out in Ukraine as they move forward with um their relationship I've
always myself felt that it was a mistake for the Trump Administration to plunge
into Ukrainian um settlement negotiations directly after Trump was
elected and I've always myself felt Al that to the extent that there has been
diplomatic interaction between the Americans and the Russians over Ukraine
it has been premature um it's taken place at a time
when Ukraine is still there in the game and where the Europeans have been able
to make use of that the Russians have to win a clearer military victory for us to
reach that point where it becomes in the interests of both the
Russians and the Americans to come to a final settlement agreement the the
Russians to secure their Western borders and the Americans to to stabilize the
situation in Europe the realities on the ground don't bring us to that point yet well the the
statement from Putin is in a way also um a final um warning to to the collective
W to Ukraine and he says it for Ukraine that that it's a type of this is your this is your last chance yes kind of
offer it's it's either istambul plus yeah take it now yeah or or we're going
to continue to to push uh further further west yes and I mean that's he
was very clear about that yes at least that's how I read his uh his statement the question is the the Trump
Administration is I believe they're absolutely ready to sign off onul plus
yes on June 2024 root causes I think they have no problem with the four
oblasts no in their entirety going to to Russia I think that uh that if they
could get zalinski and the Europeans to to play ball then then it
would be wrapped up this deal but that that that's where you have the problem is you have zinski as as president and
the United States still hasn't figured out how to how to deal with zalinski
which is kind of interesting uh perhaps this is because the the UK and the the
French are absolutely uh protecting zalinsky from what I understand the French and the UK they've created a
firewall around zalinski but um but the United States in
the negotiations with the ceasefire uh whether it was the energy infrastructure ceasefire all the blacks or the black CC
fire they gave everything to to Russia I mean whatever Russia wanted whatever they asked for uh Russia got in in those
negotiations and um it's the Europeans that are coming along and they're saying no with the Black Sea we reject it we're
not going to to liftt any sanctions so this is the opportunity another opportunity for the Trump
Administration to uh to say okay if the Europeans will pressure the Europeans
maybe we'll pressure them maybe we won't but uh whatever the the outcome if the
Europeans dig in and they say no to to lifting sanctions then obviously the
black CC's fire deal can't go anywhere and uh then we have to move onwards to
to option option b or option C wherever we are which is in my opinion you have
to deal with zilinski yes because the plan that Mike Waltz and Rubio laid out
was um we start with an energy infrastructure ceasefire then we get to the Black Sea
ceasefire then we get to an overall uh ceasefire and then we talk territory
that was how they they laid it out that was this the step process yes that they were talking about
you're it doesn't look like you're going to get past the black CC's fire no maybe the Europeans change their mind I don't
know but right now it doesn't look like that's going to happen or if it does happen it's going to take some time to
to change the minds of of the Europeans so if you're the the Trump
Administration I think they do as as you say as we've been telling them to do for six months which is you figure out a way
to to walk away from this you have another chance to walk away from this
and uh you can you can package it in a way that the American people will will
understand it makes sense yes uh will will they do it that's that's the
question will they do it um the the next step seems very clear
and I think Putin is signaling it which is we have to deal with zalinski I mean that's what the UN idea is all about
ultimately yes we have to deal with zalinsky so America
what do you say is it time for us to deal with zelinsky in a way that's that that that will be accepted by the
International Community that will be deemed as as legal which will hold elections which will lead to to
elections and and which will ultimately uh lead to to some sort of
entity a person a government whatever it is that will be internationally
recognized as signing um a negotiated settlement in Ukraine whatever whatever capitulation
is signed it will be legal it will be recognized by the International Community if you go this this un route
it's important to point out that that Putin said that this is just one idea there could be many different options uh
available going forward as to how to deal with with Ukraine and and with the zaleski regime well what he says that
when he says that there's many different options you have to be very careful because what he's basically saying he
doesn't want to be imposing something but this is clearly uh what I think he
he thinks is the only really effective way forward that that that was clearly my view reading what he said now I think
there's an important point to make here which is that over the last couple of weeks basically since this process of
American Russian R rore began um ever since the Americans started talking
about a ceasefire and an end to the war there's been lots of speculation will
Putin compromise will he move on his June 2024 positions will he agree to uh
the ukrainians retaining part of the the part of the four regions that they still
control and I think a lot of people people who um want the war to end as soon as
possible want the you know dying in the the West a lot of people in the west of
that kind have been anxious that Putin should do that and I get to say this an
awful lot of people in Russia have been worried that he might do this it's a
different perspectives um what we have seen is that Putin is not prepared to do that I
mean he is not prepared to compromise on his June 2024 positions I think when you
ask his comments um in mormans carefully you can see this he talks about the fact
you know that we control nearly all of lugans 99% of lugansk 70% of the other
three regions he's talking about it's quite clear to me that he expects that
the Russian army is going to capture all of the territory in in the three regions
more he says it he says it exactly so I mean I it doesn't seem to me as if on
this he's prepared to give an inch so um that is the reality of the position from
Putin's side and American intelligence says there's nothing the US can do to
prevent this um military support for Ukraine isn't going to be successful um
further economic sanctions on Russia aren't going to be successful now if
you'd been listening to us and People Like Us Trump would have recognized that I think from the first
day the problem has been that um within his administration he's got people with
different views and I think for a time he went on went along with Kellogg and
Rubio and Waltz who have shall we say the more conventional ideas about
how the United States should conduct his foreign policy they don't like Russia
very much they still think that Russia is a weaker party much weaker than the United States they still believe that if
the United States puts pressure on Russia it can
force the Russians to come round and that's why we had
this process of negotiations and discussions that has taken place over
the last few weeks with the Americans trying to get the Russians to agree to a ceasefire and the Americans trying to
get the Russians to agree to all sorts of things and the Americans found that
the Russians raised objections and also there has been and I
could to say it straightforward any deliberate sabotage even of this process from the ukrainians themselves from
zalinski who's not prepared to accept anything except Victory and from the
Europeans as as well who also are not prepared to accept anything except Victory I mean when they said yesterday
that sanctions will only be lifted when every single Russian soldier leaves pre
2014 Ukraine the Europe Europeans are still talking about Victory they're
about to work on their 17th sanctions package um so um those are the
realities that um Trump and Rubio Waltz and Kellog certainly TR
uh Rubio Waltz and Kellog refused to acknowledge so we are at that fork in
the road now I if the Trump Administration if Trump
himself decides to go with continue with
this walz Rubio Kellogg process takes that fork in the road then
I I I suspect that the negotiations which already look bogged down are not
going to go anywhere further um they will drag on probably for the rest of
the year the Russians will continue their advances and eventually everything
will end with a situation where the Trump Administration goes back to
Congress asks for more money it will be a return to the Biden approach all over
again uh a lot of people in the Republican Party the marjerie Toler green type
people will be furious and they'll be very very angry and um it will also be
an admission on Trump's part that all of this has failed so the only real option
as far as I can see is to do what we've said uh to
accept that this process isn't moving forward maybe too much has been invested
politically in it now to Simply abandon it so maybe we will have continued
sporadic discussions with the Russians and the ukrainians but I personally
think that is a bad idea and I suspect I strongly suspect that uh for the Trump
people the mineral rights extraction deal is that is all at least they hope
is they get out of jail card it's it's what they hope will manage finally to
escap he signs it yeah what if he signs it well he's done then I mean he's done
exactly what if he says okay I'll give you guys everything I'll give you guys well I mean exactly and then of course
um he doesn't just have to sign it the r the Ukrainian Parliament must ratify it
and apparently there's doubts about whether that will happen so it looks to me that it's been pitched
at that level where this really can't be accepted and it won't work and perhaps
at that point the Americans will say to themselves the Trump people will say to themselves well Trump will start
listening more to people like Vance and
musk and other people who I think their Instinct has been much closer to the one
that we've been setting out in the Duran then maybe the waltz Rubio Kellogg axis
has been which is that this is losing proposition for the United States uh far
too much time has been invested in it diplomatic time the president has been
distracted from other things and the time has come to start walking away yeah
well musk uh still believes that there's a stalemate so I was listening to his interview the other day with uh with
Brett Bear and he still thinks there's a stalemate and there's no movement on the front line so musk doesn't quite really
know what the situation is in Ukraine this is true I he's he's a he's way off
to be quite honest I know he wants peace yes I give him that he wants peace he
wants a negotiation so there he's right he's absolutely right but he doesn't have an understanding as to what is
going on in Ukraine he has very little understanding about what's happening on the ground I agree but I think the
difference between musk and say someone like walz is that wolsk still wants to
negotiate a um sett that is tilted in America's and
Ukraine's favor whereas musk doesn't care I mean as far as he's concerned I
mean he doesn't really care I mean he thinks this is taking up too much time and we need to walk away um uh withit go
of course has gone much further he understands that the only way that this can end is by accepting isul plus that's
best deal on the table right now for Ukraine abut for for Europe even for the
You could argue for the United States as well you could argue that plus is the
best deal absolutely just like Istanbul in March of 2022 was a great deal just like Minsk
two was a great deal just like mids Squad was a great deal before that yeah but each each deal is getting worse and
worse for Ukraine it's getting worse and worse for for Europe and for the collective West so that is why put is
saying this is it yeah you have ISO plus wickoff understands that yes I think I
think no I don't even I know that Whit cough and there's a faction in the Trump Administration that is saying just just
take Istanbul plus everybody yes take it yes we're not going to get a better deal
no exactly but but you have this Kellogg hangover this Kellogg ceasefire
DMZ uh April plan that he put out there with Walts and all of these guys and this thing is kind of this this has has
a hangover effect on on Trump and so they're saying let's negotiate this out let's go through a ceasefire fight they
this is what they chose yeah well exactly I mean this is the I mean by the
way this is exactly the pattern in previous negotiations to end uh Wars
that the United States has been involved in um you you find the same pattern with
the Vietnam War all kinds of complicated ideas um which ultimately in the end it
becomes clear the other side isn't really interested in and eventually they
fall away um if we talk about negotiations I mean people Overlook the
fact that in terms of the Paris peace talks the first six months of them this
is the negotiations to end the war the conflict in Vietnam and the first six
months were entirely taken up with protocol issues because those proved so
difficult to unravel eventually if you look at the pattern of the Paris peace
talks the Americans come up with all kinds of complicated proposals in the
end they have to accept every single proposal the North Vietnamese make well
these negotiations just to wrap up the video These negotiations also had a a bit of of that as well there's a flavor
of of protocol in these negotiations as well in that you have to get the embassies up and running yeah there were
no there was no staff in either of the embassies for three years there was no communication between Russia and the United States uh for three years and
that that's still an ongoing process yes so I mean I think it's important for everyone to understand that yes you have
project Ukraine which is which is a huge important uh topic for the United States
and Russia to discuss but they have they have all of these other things that they need to uh to go over and to fix yes
from the damage of the the Biden Administration we're talking about three three four years of just radio silence
between uh the two countries so they're going to need uh quite some time to fix all of these things staffing issues
connecting uh the banks to the embassies getting the proper the proper officials in in in each country I mean there
there's so much that they have to go over yes um Biden did did a tremendous
amount of damage to the atal relations between uh uh Trump and uh and
Russia so uh the um the trajectory seems to be uh towards
either either Istanbul Plus or uh or let's talk about the the UN and we can
deal with our mutual headache uh the US and Russia which is uh this this man in
in Kiev who is a who was a pain in the butt for for both uh both countries uh
you know just the final thought and we'll wrap up the video um when you take a step back yes this is
a proxy war we've been saying it forever we understand the US is at war with
Russia Ukraine is the proxy uh but the reality is that uh that
the United States is is speaking with Russia they're negotiating with Russia
Europe could have done the same they could have gotten on a plane to Moscow
and they could have also decided to to speak to Russia I don't know who the Europeans would send I don't know do you
send Kaa Callis do you send Ursula this I don't know but um but the Trump Administration they decided they're
gonna they're going to try to negotiate this the negotiations will we'll see how they unfold it does appear as if we're
stuck on this Black Sea ceasefire um agreement but there is an option that Putin has now put on the table which is
this un uh governance idea and if you're the Trump
Administration there is a way that you can spin this yes to your favor it's not a hard one no to spin no uh we are
getting close to a deal with Russia everybody uh yes we got two ceasefires
agreed on you could say that we agreed on on on ceasefires yeah and uh and now
we're looking at the Democracy of Ukraine I you could position it in in in those terms we're looking at at getting
democracy back on track in Ukraine we're looking at elections in Ukraine isn't that wonderful isn't that great uh the
UN is going to help us out in this I mean there's there's there's a clear way that you can spin this for for the for
the uh Maga crowd or the everyday American who hasn't been so plugged into what has been going on in Ukraine as we
have or our viewers have uh which would would lead them to believe that this is a win for for Trump I mean it can be
marketed and packaged as a win but Trump needs to uh to make the right
decision because as you said If he if he decides to continue to go down this Kellogg Waltz route yeah then once again
he's getting ownership of the conflict a military defeat for Ukraine is going to happen and he's going to be stuck with
it exactly so so take this this offer that that Putin is is putting out on the
table and uh and push through this uh
this could be pushed through what could be a settlement to to Ukraine absolutely
that's exactly right I mean in my opinion if he if he continues along the Kellogg um Walts route he'll end up
being Joe Biden I mean which is presumably not what he wants much better
to come to terms um and the terms on offer are Istanbul plus now that does
leave the problem of zalinski but you know if the Americans and the Russ Russians can come to an understanding
with each other well probably there were ways to work that out and I don't think this is a hard cell in the United States
at all I mean it's important to remember that Donald Trump won the election in
November on the basis that he would not in you know involve commit the United
States to further conflict in Ukraine he's the hard cell the really hard cell
with the Maga people would be if he came back in say August and told said that
you know Ukraine we run out of funding for Ukraine we need another $60 billion
appropriation the that that is that would be a much harder sell than what
you said I think Americans care very much about Ukraine to be honest I think they're more concerned with the many
many pressing problems closer to home now as for the Europeans well the
Europeans are are themselves into an Ever deeper hole on Ukraine and it is
really depressing uh to watch one European
government is rebelling and that's hungar Peter Cato the Hungarian foreign
minister is going to Moscow and we'll see what comes of his discussions with the Russians now uh there is a
possibility because sanctions have to be renewed every six months or so that the
hungarians and the slovaks might start imposing vetos now the the problem with that is I
don't think the Europeans will pay much notice I know I know people simply don't believe me about
this but even if there is a veto in the European Council about rolling over
sanctions I think the European States the other ones will simply agree with each other that they will continue to
enforce them anyway yeah uh I think they'll no I think
they'll continue with sanctions they'll continue with uh with trying to escalate I think even when the conflict is
wrapped up they they could still be talking about escalation no joke but because for the Europeans the way I look
at the Europeans at this point in time is that uh every leader in uh in Europe
outside of of Hungary and Slovakia for their own reasons uh they they like the the topic
of Ukraine they like to go to these Summits it acts as a distraction it acts as a way of of of not talking about the
the problems in their own country uh for some leaders it makes them feel very very large very important uh so so they
like to go to to these events they like to talk about defeating Russia they like to all pretend that their their Church
Hill and um I I I've come to the conclusion that for the Europeans uh for
the European leaders that we currently have have in place uh they have no problem with uh with continuing to
de-industrialized Europe and continuing to make it harder for the uh for the everyday European citizen to continue to
make them poor because if they can make them poor then you know they they make themselves richer and I look at this as
as very much a wealth transfer and uh they're not concerned about being voted out of out of office I mean macaron and
and all of these people I don't think they care about being voted out of office I think in the UK whether it's uh
uh conservative or labor it doesn't really matter if uh if they can continue
to to centralize power uh using Putin as the excuse if they can continue to
transfer wealth from uh from the everyday people to to themselves using
Putin as an excuse and so be it I I think they have no real incentive to uh
to deescalate or or to find a solution to the conflict in Ukraine and and also
for political purposes they don't want to admit that they've lost so so I think they'll just
continue to go on with this for the next year two years 10 years 50 years really
they'll just continue to go on with this charade that they're fighting Russia that they're uh they're defending Europe
and um it benefits them they realize they have no democracy the people have no recourse
and so why not continue to to go along with this it makes us
money it uh it benefits us it benefits our uh our
donors why deal with why why deal with dialogue with Russia well they don't want dialogue with Russia I mean I the
the latest meeting made that Crystal Clear I mean matro urula um U starma obviously Ms and
Schultz as well that they're they're not looking for dialogue with Russia um I think that they're absolutely focused on
centralizing Europe around the European commission the European project and as
you absolutely rightly say conflict with Russia serves their interests and if
they can prolong a conflict with Russia and get the Americans to stay so much the better and I suspect some of them um
have now drunk the Kool-Aid of remilitarization and all that and I I suspect that they believe
this is one of the features of European Mone for them it's money for them it's money for them it's it's it's like
telling them you you you don't want to pay yourselves x amount of money exactly
of course they're going to jump at it yeah we're gonna create this big fund where everyone can dip into it or at
least everyone in the club can dip into it of course they're G to they're going to jump on this as they did with every
other fund before the the the coup fund everything it's the same it's the same formula over and over again it's the
European people that uh that can't they can't vote these people out no that's
the problem and they know it exactly exactly uh we'll wrap it up the d.
