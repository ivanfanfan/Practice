good day today is Tuesday 8th April 2025 and we are several days further a
whole week further into the great trade uh tariff crisis um which began with
President Trump's liberation day his announcement of tariffs against well
pretty much most countries around the world and over that over that period of
time we've seen crashing financial markets crashing energy prices and this
morning surprise surprise we've had an upward bounce now this appears to be
based on nothing other than a message on Truth Social by President Trump that
he's had a telephone call with the acting president of South Korea now I say the acting president of South Korea
because South Korea's longunning political crisis which began when the
previous president President Yun um declared um a state of emergency and
martial law and tried to dissolve parliament and close down the media and
arrest his political opponents finally after many twists and turns
after uh standoffs between the president and his supporters um between um
supporters of the president and sections of the military on the one hand and the
parliamentary leadership and their supporters on the other well that
political crisis at least for the moment appears to have been resolved with a
unanimous decision a few days ago of South Korea's Supreme Court to uphold
President Yun's impeachment the result is the president pun is now Mune is now
out of office and we have an active acting president whose first task
apparently was to telephone Donald Trump and try to persuade Donald Trump to
agree to a South Korean delegation trade delegation rushing to the United States
to see if something could be agreed with the United States u with Trump uh which
might cause the tariffs against South Korea to be relaxed so President Trump
as he always does then made posted a comment on True Social talking about the
fact that he'd had an excellent call with the acting president of South Korea that the South Koreans seemed in earnest
about talking about all of the things that he was serious about he added that he's going to or rather his negotiators
will be bringing up all sorts of other things which appear to be entirely unrelated to the tariff issues which is
interesting but he says you know it's always nice to deal with all the problems at once which is well one way
of approaching negotiations I suppose but anyway that's what he writes on this truth social post and of course he also
says that He's looking forward and expects to make a great deal which is
always part of what Trump says and what Donald Trump says he will do and as far
as I can see on the strength of that one post and of course all the rumors and
messages and whispers that have been circulating that up to 70 countries are contacting the United States that
there's a rush to try to find some means of placating the United States of
getting the Americans to shift on their tariffs well on that basis the markets
today have staged a wobbly recovery oil prices have risen stock markets have
risen and there seems to be some expectation or some hope that everything
over the next couple of days will change and that this massive hike in
tariffs was basically some great negotiating ploy by Donald Trump one
intended to extract from concessions from all sorts of countries around the
world well I am not quite sure why people cling to this because um other
countries have also made attempts to try to get the United States to cancel the
tariffs that it has now imposed upon them vietnam tried the Vietnamese have
made all kinds of urgent requests to the Americans to get the tariffs reduced
they've actually said that they're happy to move to a zero tariffs system with
the United States um their calls their requests for a tariff
relaxation so far as I can see have been completely ignored the United States
listened to them and slammed the door back in their faces and no less aer
person the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel Donald Trump's friend leader of Israel the country
which um has positioned itself as America's most important truest most
faithful ally in the Middle East the country that Donald Trump himself has repeatedly spoken about in
the f friend friendliest and warmest terms well he also has rushed to
Washington he's trying to get the 17% tariffs on Israeli exports to the United
States negotiated downwards these will according apparently to Israeli economic
officials and business people deal a severe blow to Israel's economy which is
of course already in difficulties given the long war that Israel has been in
since 7th October 2023 and the Hamas attack on um Israel
anyway in spite of all of that in spite of all the friendship all the warm words that Netanyahu and Trump have exchanged
with each other over many years again it seems as if at least for the moment
Netanyahu has fallen short he met with Trump he spoke with Trump he pleaded
with Trump but Trump as he always does spoke f in a very friendly way very
favorable to Netanyahu said all sorts of complimentary and kind things to him but
he didn't in he didn't in the end do what Netanyahu wanted he didn't reduce
the tariffs i have to say this visit by Netanyahu to Washington and Trump's
response to Netanyahu did remind me a little of the visits a few weeks ago of MRO and
Starmmer to Washington when they were also trying to get Donald Trump to do
something that basically he wasn't at all minded to do which is to give a
promise of a milit military backs stop a military guarantee an undertaking that
the United States would be there to support the British and the French
when British and French troops were deployed onto the territory of Ukraine
and Trump responded in exactly the same way as he did to as he's just done with
Netanyahu he talked very favorably in his usual
sometimes somewhat rambling way um pretending not to hear exactly what his
interlocutor be it Macron star or Netanyahu is saying he showers his
interlocutor with compliments he gives the impression that they're best friends
but at the end of it all the interlocutor goes away with nothing he goes away empty-handed without the thing
that he came to Washington asking for
anyway that's where we are at the moment now of course it may be that I am wrong
and it may be that the South Koreans will come to Washington and they will successfully negotiate and Donald Trump
will indeed at that point decide to reduce the tariffs on South
Korea but given the whole trend of US policy firstly I think that is unlikely
that is my own sense but secondly if that does indeed happen then I suspect
that the reality will be that South Korea will nonetheless maintain its
trade surplus with the United States in fact I would expect that trade surplus
to grow substantially given that Chinese competition for example is being reduced
and I would guess that Trump in time would not like that very much he'd start
complaining that the South Koreans were once again cheating the United States
and we'd get back to the tariffs again i noticed that Trump for example in that
truth social post spoke about South Korea's unsustainable
uh trade surplus something which he clearly feels very agrieved about anyway
for the record I think that he will do what he consistently does he will
suggest that a deal is ready there for the making it's just around the corner
that he's prepared to give ground and all of that um but that in the end
whoever comes and asks for that deal is going to be
disappointed well South Korea is a big industrial industrialized country it's a
major exporter but of course it is dwarfed by China and here the story is very
different because um the Chinese in response to the tariffs that President
Trump has imposed on them which cumulatively come to 54% of the value of
goods that China exports to the United States well the Chinese slapped a retali
a retaliatory tariff of 34% on American goods which are being exported to China
and Donald Trump has reacted very negatively to this he has said that um
if the Chinese don't cancel that 34% tariff on American goods which they ex
imposed by um I think it was the 8th of April well he will impose a retaliatory
tariff on China of a further 50% i'm not
sure whether it was the 8th of April maybe it may have been the 28th of April actually but anyway he's threatening to
impose a massive further 50% tariff on China over and above the tariff that he
has already imposed now that would bring tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the
United States at over 100% um massive tariffs
tariffs which if they are indeed implemented are going to put China's
trade the trade between China and the United States in a critical
position now China and the United States are the two countries that trade most
with each other in the world they are the two biggest economic players china
exports huge quantities of goods to the United States the United States in turn exports
not in substantial quantities of goods to China and by the way part of the
trade in goods from China to the United States is still goods
manufactured in China by American companies that have located their
production in China and which ma manufacture their goods in
China so that they can be exported back to the United states Apple being one
example amongst many so what happens to the Chinese
American relationship is very important it in fact it is crucial now earlier
today um Alex Christophoro and I um were privileged to do a live stream on the
Duran with Professor Jeffrey Saxs of Columbia University he of course is um
somebody who's been u making extremely cogent and important criticisms of this
entire tariff policy that the Trump administration has been following he has
explained um clearly and precisely why
the tariffs are not going to resolve America's economic problems that they're
not going to correct the deficits the twin deficits the current account
deficit that the United States has been running for decades it is an essential program to
watch for anyone who wants to understand the economic consequences of
this policy um I say that um notwithstanding my own understanding as
to how these tariffs came about and why Donald Trump decided to go this route as
I have also said I don't believe that the economic system which existed before
Donald Trump came in and began all of these moves was a sustainable one anyway
but anyway that's another question i don't want to go into the economics of this but one point that Professor Saxs
did make is that he did wonder whether ultimately this whole business of
imposing tariffs across the world right across the
world isn't ultimately um some kind of
complicated device to try to turn as many countries as possible against China
to get these countries to cut deals with the United States even as the United
States conducts its economic war against China well if that is the plan and I
don't believe it is by the way and I the reason I don't believe it is is because Donald Trump has been talking about
tariffs as far as I can see pretty much all of his life going back at least to
the 1980s he's been a consistent supporter of tariffs and of protection he's one of
these people who undoubtedly well I am sure is sincere in his belief that
tariffs are the way forward to resolve America's deep economic problems so I I
don't think this is just a cunning plan to isolate China and at the same time to
put a squeeze on its economy but if it is then I'm going to say two
things first on its own terms it will fail china is too important a country
for too much of the world for that part of the world which trades with China in
that kind of way to choose to turn it their backs on it they're more likely in
the end to side with China in such an economic war than they are with the
United States the African countries being a case in point many of the Asian
countries ultimately also by the way just for the record Russia too and I
suspect in time India also that's the first thing to say the second is that if
we are really looking at a world in which the United States while
applying 100% tariffs against China in intended to drive Chinese goods clearly
the objective would be to drive Chinese goods entirely out of the United States
to rid the United States of all Chinese imports at all well if that is the plan
to isolate China and to deal with the trade with China in that sort of way
then that is a direct economic war by the United States against
China one as grandiose and as ambitious
as the economic war that the Biden administration launched against Russia
directly after the start of the special military operation just saying so um
just as that economic war ultimately failed and in the end had a more
negative impact on the United States or certainly on America's allies maybe not
so much on the United States than it did on the intended adversary which was
Russia so I expect this economic war to
have that same effect now the Chinese have been responding to all of this
unsurprisingly today or I think it was yesterday the Chinese foreign ministry official said that China will not back
down that China will continue as it has been doing that it will fight an
economic war if that is what is forced upon China to the end with every
expectation that in the end it will emerge victorious is that is what the
um Chinese um foreign foreign ministry has been
saying but there's been a much more thorough much more interesting
um response to this whole tariff policy a more detailed response one which
undoubtedly reflects the sentiments of the Chinese leadership but I'm also
going to say which I have no doubt at all finds a strong echo amongst Chinese
society in general anyway there's been a powerful
editorial in connection with all of this by global from Global Times which is of
course um a newspaper owned by the people's daily which is the official
newspaper of the Chinese of the Communist Party of China and which therefore means that global times itself
is in effect the a voice of the Chinese government And well I'm not going to
read the entire editorial which is fairly long but it speaks that it says
that China will take continue to take resolute and strong measures as the
United States threatens a further 50% tariff on
China and the editorial contains comments like this the United States's abuse of
tariffs severely violates the legitimate rights and interests of all countries
breaches World Trade Organization rules undermines the rules-based multilateral
trading system and disrupts global economic stability this is a typical act
of unilateralism protectionism and economic bullying which has drawn
widespread international opposition china strongly condemns this and opposes
this we will continue to take strong resolute measures to safeguard our
legitimate interests so that is of course all a quote from the Chinese
foreign ministry but then um the um um but then um China itself as I said
in this editorial goes on to say tariff blackmail cannot intimidate China um the
US government under the guise of repressiprocity has announced tariff hikes on all trade partners including
China the Chinese government's position in opposing the US abuse of tariffs
emphasizes that the United States has used tariffs as a tool for extreme
pressure and to pursue selfish interests
um China um will uh ch tariff blackmail
will not intimidate China nor will it undermine justice china does not provoke
trouble nor is it intimidated by tr trouble pressuring and threatening are
not the right way in dealing with China and then the article goes on to say that
the claims about unfair foreign trade practices are untrue um um that the
attack on China is an attack on China's legitimate rights in global trade as
well as its longstanding efforts to open up the so-called reciprocal tariffs have
caused enormous damage to the world trading system and global supply chains and they will pose a serious drag on
global economic growth and then what I think is perhaps the most
important sections in this editorial china is an ancient
civilization known for its traditions of etiquette and respect the Chinese people
value sincerity and trust as the foundation of their relationships standing firm in the face
of pressure and threats is equally a defining trait of the Chinese spirit
looking back at history China stood tall e even in times of poverty and weakness
much less will it ever yield to hegemony today compared to the US government's
initiation of a trade war with China in 2017 today we have a much stronger
capacity to withstand pressure richer experience in handling struggles and
comprehensive preparations to face challenges china's industrial system and
technological autonomy have significantly improved its domestic
market and econ economic stretch structure continue to optimize and its
multilateral cooperation and trade partnerships have become more diverse
these factors give China greater confidence in the face of risks
more importantly China stands on the side of morality and historical right
the United States's latest round of tariff hikes targets more than 180
countries and regions around the world including even the United Nations
designated least developed countries some commentators have noticed that such
high tariffs will deal a devastating blow to vulnerable nations chisner's counter measures are
not a call to confrontation but a declaration to defend fairness and then
the article goes on the trade the editorial goes on the trade volume between China and the United States is
enormous the high tariffs imposed by the United States will inevitably impact the
Chinese economy in the short term china has ultimately made a difficult but
correct decision this confidence stems not only from China's economic strength
but also from the fact that countries globally are participating in economic
globalization and benefiting from it as well as from the depth and breadth of
economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States
no one can stop China's development uh and China China US economic and trade
cooperation aligns with the will of the people the trend towards economic
globalization here I should make it clear by the way that the Chinese always use the expression globalization in a
different way from the way in which it is used in the west what the Chinese basically mean by globalization is free
trade in goods they have never subscribed to the other aspects of
globalization technocratic governance and governance from single centers and
all of those kind of things and uh anyway that's a whole further subject
for discussion time will ultimately prove that the tide of history is
unstoppable moving forward relentlessly and that the Chinese people possess
sufficient wisdom and strength to meet challenges both today and in the future
china will continue to stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of
human civilization's progress working together with the international community to contribute greater strength
to humanity's peaceful development we urge Washington to immediately stop
unilateral tariff measures and to resolve trade differences in an equal respectful and reciprocal manner well
maybe you take a cynical view of all of these statements that the Chinese are
making again I differ just as I believe that Donald Trump is sincere in believing that his
tariffs are the way to regenerate the industrial heartlands of the United
States that he is absolutely serious about what he's doing and that he's
acting from conviction i believe that the Chinese believe the same about
themselves i think that they do draw strength from their long history the
longest history of any state existing today they draw stren they draw strength
also from the enormous growth of their society and economy over the last 50
plus years and they also believe just as they say that they are
in the right on this issue so we are looking at an economic war
between titans and I think anybody in the United States who thinks that the
Chinese are just going to roll over and capitulate and do a deal on Donald Trump's terms are probably going to be
disappointed that is my own view about this and it is this collapse in trade
between China and the United States which will shape the economy of the
future and which will certainly lead us into a more uh
blockdriven economic world than the one we have known up to now now there's a
few further points to make here as well if Professor Saxs is right or I'm not sure that this is exactly his belief but
if his suggestion he's because he expressed it as a possibility he made it
clear that he didn't know that this was indeed the objective but
if the objective is as professor
Saxs floated the possibility that it might be that this is all some kind of
plan to isolate China the better to wage economic war upon it then of course this
isn't about tariffs it isn't about rebuilding the US economy it isn't about
restoring jobs to the United States's industrial heartlands at all it is about
waging economic war against an adversary
a rival and putting that
way you can see that the argument from
China's side that right in that case is on its side would have even greater
force in fact it would at that point unquestionably be true it would be a
deeply cynical motivation on the part of the United States and the Chinese would
be right in arguing that right was on their side for the record and just to
repeat again I don't think it is that way i don't think that is Trump's own thinking his own
reasoning in taking these steps that's the first thing I'm going to say the
second is that an awful lot of people have been writing recently about the
Nixon shock of the early 1970s about how the United States
responded um to the gathering economic pressures
